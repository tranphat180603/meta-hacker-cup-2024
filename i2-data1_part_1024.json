        "instruction": "Vasya has got a magic matrix a of size n \u00d7 m. The rows of the matrix are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, the columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. Let a_{ij} be the element in the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column.\n\nVasya has also got a chip. Initially, the chip is in the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column (that is, in the element a_{rc}). Vasya performs the following process as long as possible: among all elements of the matrix having their value less than the value of the element with the chip in it, Vasya randomly and equiprobably chooses one element and moves his chip to this element.\n\nAfter moving the chip, he adds to his score the square of the Euclidean distance between these elements (that is, between the element in which the chip is now and the element the chip was moved from). The process ends when there are no elements having their values less than the value of the element with the chip in it.\n\nEuclidean distance between matrix elements with coordinates (i_1, j_1) and (i_2, j_2) is equal to \u221a{(i_1-i_2)^2 + (j_1-j_2)^2}.\n\nCalculate the expected value of the Vasya's final score.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be represented as P/Q, where P and Q are coprime integer numbers, and Q not\u2261 0~(mod ~ 998244353). Print the value P \u22c5 Q^{-1} modulo 998244353.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix a.\n\nThe following n lines contain description of the matrix a. The i-th line contains m integers a_{i1}, a_{i2}, ..., a_{im} ~ (0 \u2264 a_{ij} \u2264 10^9).\n\nThe following line contains two integers r and c (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m) \u2014 the index of row and the index of column where the chip is now.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the expected value of Vasya's final score in the format described in the problem statement.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n1 4\n1 1 2 1\n1 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n2 3\n1 5 7\n2 3 1\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n665496238\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, Vasya will move his chip exactly once. The expected value of the final score is equal to (1^2 + 2^2+ 1^2)/(3) = 2.",

        "instruction": "You stumbled upon a new kind of chess puzzles. The chessboard you are given is not necesserily 8 \u00d7 8, but it still is N \u00d7 N. Each square has some number written on it, all the numbers are from 1 to N^2 and all the numbers are pairwise distinct. The j-th square in the i-th row has a number A_{ij} written on it.\n\nIn your chess set you have only three pieces: a knight, a bishop and a rook. At first, you put one of them on the square with the number 1 (you can choose which one). Then you want to reach square 2 (possibly passing through some other squares in process), then square 3 and so on until you reach square N^2. In one step you are allowed to either make a valid move with the current piece or replace it with some other piece. Each square can be visited arbitrary number of times.\n\nA knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. A bishop moves diagonally. A rook moves horizontally or vertically. The move should be performed to a different square from the one a piece is currently standing on.\n\nYou want to minimize the number of steps of the whole traversal. Among all the paths to have the same number of steps you want to choose the one with the lowest number of piece replacements.\n\nWhat is the path you should take to satisfy all conditions?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer N (3 \u2264 N \u2264 10) \u2014 the size of the chessboard.\n\nEach of the next N lines contains N integers A_{i1}, A_{i2}, ..., A_{iN} (1 \u2264 A_{ij} \u2264 N^2) \u2014 the numbers written on the squares of the i-th row of the board.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all A_{ij} are pairwise distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nThe only line should contain two integers \u2014 the number of steps in the best answer and the number of replacement moves in it.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n3\n1 9 3\n8 6 7\n4 2 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n12 1\n\nNote\n\nHere are the steps for the first example (the starting piece is a knight):\n\n  1.

The j-th of them is given as a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 \u2264 y_i \u2264 x_i \u2264 n) and means that if Misha buys exactly x_i shovels during some purchase, then he can take y_i most cheapest of them for free.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum cost of buying k shovels if Misha buys them optimally.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n7 4 5\n2 5 4 2 6 3 1\n2 1\n6 5\n2 1\n3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n7\n\n\nInput\n\n\n9 4 8\n6 8 5 1 8 1 1 2 1\n9 2\n8 4\n5 3\n9 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n17\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 1 4\n2 5 7 4 6\n5 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n17\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example Misha can buy shovels on positions 1 and 4 (both with costs 2) during the first purchase and get one of them for free using the first or the third special offer. And then he can buy shovels on positions 3 and 6 (with costs 4 and 3) during the second purchase and get the second one for free using the first or the third special offer. Then he can buy the shovel on a position 7 with cost 1. So the total cost is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nIn the second example Misha can buy shovels on positions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 (costs are 6, 8, 5, 1 and 2) and get three cheapest (with costs 5, 1 and 2) for free. And then he can buy shovels on positions 6, 7 and 9 (all with costs 1) without using any special offers. So the total cost is 6 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17.\n\nIn the third example Misha can buy four cheapest shovels without using any special offers and get the total cost 17.",

These vertices are potential roots for the snake to reverse itself.\n9. If there are no potential roots, output \"NO\".\n10. Otherwise, select one of the potential roots as the root `rt`.\n11. Perform a DFS from the root `rt` to calculate the maximum depth of each vertex's subtree, considering the head and tail of the snake.\n12. Build the LCA table using the depth information.\n13. Simulate the snake's movement by iteratively moving the head and tail towards each other, using the LCA table to find the next vertex to move to.\n14. If the snake can reach the head and tail in the same position, output \"YES\". Otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nusing ll = long long;\nusing ld = long double;\nconst ll MOD = 1000000007;\n\n// Function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers\nint gcd(int a, int b) { \n  return b?

Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.\n\nTo make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

Iterate through the `domino` vector and for each pair of adjacent dominoes, find the corresponding domino in the `a` array and print its index along with the direction of rotation (\"+\" or \"-\").\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int M = 100 + 20;\npair<int, int> a[M]; // array to store dominoes' properties\nchar dir; // direction of rotation\nvector<int> domino; // vector to store domino indices in the correct order\nvector<pair<int, int> > adj[M]; // adjacency list for each domino\nbool mark[M], check[M]; // boolean arrays for DFS and checking\nint cnt, start = -1, p[M]; // count of dominoes with odd edges, starting domino index, and parent array for DFS\n\n// DFS function to traverse the graph and find the correct domino order\nvoid dfs(int v) {\n  while (!adj[v].empty()) { // while there are still unvisited edges from the current domino\n    int u = adj[v].back().first; // get the adjacent domino\n    int ind = adj[v].back().second; // get the index of the adjacent domino\n    adj[v].pop_back(); // remove the visited edge\n    if (!mark[ind]) { // if the adjacent domino has not been visited\n      mark[ind] = true; // mark it as visited\n      dfs(u); // recursively visit the adjacent domino\n    }\n  }\n  domino.push_back(v); // add the current domino to the correct order\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int n; // number of dominoes\n  cin >> n;\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // read domino properties and build the adjacency list\n    cin >> a[i].first >> a[i].second;\n    adj[a[i].first].push_back({a[i].second, i}); // add edge for left side\n    adj[a[i].second].push_back({a[i].first, i}); // add edge for right side\n  }\n  for (int i = 0; i <= 6; i++) { // count dominoes with odd edges\n    if (adj[i].size() % 2 == 1) {\n      cnt++;\n      start = i; // if there's a domino with an odd number of edges, use it as the starting point\n    }\n  }\n  if (cnt > 2) { // if there are more than two dominoes with odd edges, it's impossible to arrange the dominoes\n    cout << \"No solution\";\n    return 0;\n  }\n  if (start >= 0) { // if there's a domino with an odd number of edges, use it as the starting point for DFS\n    dfs(start);\n  } else { // otherwise, choose an arbitrary domino as the starting point\n    for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {\n      if (adj[i].size()) start = i;\n    }\n    dfs(start);\n  }\n  if (domino.size()!= n + 1) { // if the length of the domino vector is not equal to n + 1, it's impossible to arrange the dominoes\n    cout << \"No solution\\n\";\n    return 0;\n  }\n  for (int i = 0; i < domino.size() - 1; i++) { // iterate through the domino vector\n    int u = domino[i]; // get the current domino\n    int v = domino[i + 1]; // get the next domino\n    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) { // find the corresponding domino in the a array\n      if (!check[j]) {\n        if (a[j].first == u && a[j].second == v) { // if the current domino matches the next domino, print its index and direction\n          cout << j << \" \"\n               << \"+\"\n               << \"\\n\";\n          check[j] = true; // mark the domino as checked\n          break;\n        }\n        if (a[j].first == v && a[j].second == u) { // if the current domino matches the next domino with rotation, print its index and direction\n          cout << j << \" \"\n               << \"-\\n\";\n          check[j] = true; // mark the domino as checked\n          break;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

        "instruction": "You have a set of dominoes. Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ends. Can you put all dominoes in a line one by one from left to right so that any two dominoes touched with the sides that had the same number of points? You can rotate the dominoes, changing the left and the right side (domino \"1-4\" turns into \"4-1\").\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Next n lines contains the dominoes. Each of these lines contains two numbers \u2014 the number of points (spots) on the left and the right half, correspondingly. The numbers of points (spots) are non-negative integers from 0 to 6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint \"No solution\", if it is impossible to arrange the dominoes in the required manner.

Read the properties of each domino (left and right spots) and update the graph `g` and degree array `d` accordingly.\n3. Find the starting spot `s` for the Eulerian path, which should have an odd degree.\n4. Check if there are more than two spots with odd degrees. If so, it's impossible to arrange the dominoes.\n5. Perform an Eulerian path traversal starting from the spot `s` to find a valid arrangement of dominoes.\n6. If the Eulerian path has a length less than `n`, it's impossible to arrange the dominoes.\n7. Initialize a boolean array `chk` to keep track of used dominoes.\n8. Iterate through the Eulerian path in reverse order and find the corresponding dominoes in the graph `g`. If a match is found, print the domino's index and the rotation direction (`+` or `-`).\n9.
