Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find a valid cycle: Start the DFS from vertex `1` and try to find a cycle that includes all vertices. The DFS function `dfs` takes three parameters: the current vertex `a`, the previous vertex `b`, and the previous edge `f`.\n5.

We need to find a set of points such that when the given code is run on this set, the total number of operations exceeds k.\n3. To achieve this, we need to maximize the number of operations performed by the code. The code has two nested loops, and the number of operations is proportional to the number of iterations of these loops.\n4.

This means that the inner loop will iterate more times if the points are arranged in a way that the difference in x-coordinates is minimized.\n5. To maximize the number of operations, we need to minimize the difference in x-coordinates of consecutive points while ensuring that the points are distinct and within the given range.\n6. We can achieve this by arranging the points in a way that their x-coordinates are the same, and their y-coordinates are consecutive integers.\n7.

Perform a binary search to find the minimum number of sheets `ans` that can be used to form the string `s`.\n5. For each possible number of sheets `mid` in the search range, calculate the total number of each character needed `need` by dividing the frequency of each character by `mid` and rounding up to the nearest integer.\n6. If `need` is less than or equal to `n`, update `ans` to `mid` and adjust the search range to `hi = mid - 1`. Otherwise, adjust the search range to `lo = mid + 1`.\n7. Once the binary search is complete, print the minimum number of sheets `ans` that need to be bought.\n8. Construct a string representing a possible sheet of stickers by iterating over the frequency array and printing each character the required number of times.

This can either happen with the right tree falling left first, which has <image> probability (also knocking down the left tree), or the left tree can fall left and then the right tree can fall left, which has <image> probability. Total probability is <image>. \n\n2. Both trees fall right. This is analogous to (1), so the probability of this happening is <image>. \n\n3. The left tree fall left and the right tree falls right. This is the only remaining scenario so it must have <image> probability. \n\nCases 1 and 2 lead to a total of 3 units of ground covered, while case 3 leads to a total of 4 units of ground covered. Thus, the expected value is <image>.",

Check if the smallest side (at index 0) is not equal to the starting side length a. If it's not, proceed to adjust the side lengths.\n6. Determine the indices of the other two sides (x and y) based on the current smallest side's index (i).\n7. Calculate the new length for the smallest side by taking the minimum of the starting side length a and the absolute difference between the sum of the other two sides and 1, minus 1. This ensures that the new side length is an integer and the triangle remains non-degenerate.\n8. Increment the counter `cnt` to track the number of seconds required.\n9. Repeat steps 4-8 until the current triangle's side lengths match the starting side length a.\n10.

        "instruction": "Very soon there will be a parade of victory over alien invaders in Berland. Unfortunately, all soldiers died in the war and now the army consists of entirely new recruits, many of whom do not even know from which leg they should begin to march. The civilian population also poorly understands from which leg recruits begin to march, so it is only important how many soldiers march in step.\n\nThere will be n columns participating in the parade, the i-th column consists of li soldiers, who start to march from left leg, and ri soldiers, who start to march from right leg.\n\nThe beauty of the parade is calculated by the following formula: if L is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the left leg, and R is the total number of soldiers on the parade who start to march from the right leg, so the beauty will equal |L - R|.\n\nNo more than once you can choose one column and tell all the soldiers in this column to switch starting leg, i.e. everyone in this columns who starts the march from left leg will now start it from right leg, and vice versa. Formally, you can pick no more than one index i and swap values li and ri. \n\nFind the index of the column, such that switching the starting leg for soldiers in it will maximize the the beauty of the parade, or determine, that no such operation can increase the current beauty.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of columns. \n\nThe next n lines contain the pairs of integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li, ri \u2264 500) \u2014 the number of soldiers in the i-th column which start to march from the left or the right leg respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint single integer k \u2014 the number of the column in which soldiers need to change the leg from which they start to march, or 0 if the maximum beauty is already reached.\n\nConsider that columns are numbered from 1 to n in the order they are given in the input data.\n\nIf there are several answers, print any of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3\n5 6\n8 9\n10 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n2\n6 5\n5 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n6\n5 9\n1 3\n4 8\n4 5\n23 54\n12 32\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example if you don't give the order to change the leg, the number of soldiers, who start to march from the left leg, would equal 5 + 8 + 10 = 23, and from the right leg \u2014 6 + 9 + 3 = 18. In this case the beauty of the parade will equal |23 - 18| = 5.\n\nIf you give the order to change the leg to the third column, so the number of soldiers, who march from the left leg, will equal 5 + 8 + 3 = 16, and who march from the right leg \u2014 6 + 9 + 10 = 25. In this case the beauty equals |16 - 25| = 9.\n\nIt is impossible to reach greater beauty by giving another orders. Thus, the maximum beauty that can be achieved is 9.",

        "instruction": "Boris really likes numbers and even owns a small shop selling interesting numbers. He has n decimal numbers Bi. Cost of the number in his shop is equal to the sum of costs of its digits. You are given the values cd, where cd is the cost of the digit d. Of course, Boris is interested in that numbers he owns have the maximum cost possible.\n\nRecently Boris got hold of the magical artifact A, which can allow him to increase the cost of his collection. Artifact is a string, consisting of digits and '?' symbols. To use the artifact, Boris must replace all '?' with digits to get a decimal number without leading zeros (it is also not allowed to get number 0). After that, the resulting number is added to all numbers Bi in Boris' collection. He uses the artifact exactly once.\n\nWhat is the maximum cost of the collection Boris can achieve after using the artifact?\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains artifact A, consisting of digits '0'\u2013'9' and '?' symbols (1 \u2264 |A| \u2264 1000). Next line contains n \u2014 the amount of numbers in Boris' collection (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000). Next n lines contain integers Bi (1 \u2264 Bi < 101000). A doesn't start with '0'.\n\nLast line contains ten integers \u2014 costs of digits c0, c1, ..., c9 (0 \u2264 ci \u2264 1000).\n\nOutput\n\nOutput one integer \u2014 the maximum possible cost of the collection after using the artifact.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n42\n3\n89\n1\n958\n0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n?5?\n4\n2203\n5229\n276\n6243\n2 1 6 1 1 2 5 2 2 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n62\n\nNote\n\nIn the second sample input, the optimal way is to compose the number 453. After adding this number, Boris will have numbers 2656, 5682, 729 and 6696. The total cost of all digits in them is equal to 18 + 15 + 11 + 18 = 62. ",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n\n1. Read the artifact string A and store its digits in an array A. If a digit is '?', store -1 instead.\n2. Reverse the artifact string A to match the order of digits in the numbers in Boris' collection.\n3. Read the number of numbers in Boris' collection n and store each number in an array B. Reverse each number to match the order of digits in the artifact string A.\n4. Read the costs of digits c and store them in an array c.\n5. Initialize a 2D array dp to store the maximum cost of the collection after using the artifact for each prefix of the artifact string A and each possible state of the numbers in Boris' collection.\n6. Initialize two vectors cur and nxt to store the current and next states of the numbers in Boris' collection, respectively.\n7. Iterate over each prefix of the artifact string A from left to right.\n8. For each prefix, iterate over each possible digit that can be appended to the prefix.\n9. If the digit is not '?', update the next state of the numbers in Boris' collection by appending the numbers that end with the current digit to the next state.\n10. If the digit is '?', update the next state of the numbers in Boris' collection by appending the numbers that end with any digit to the next state.\n11. For each possible state of the numbers in Boris' collection, calculate the maximum cost of the collection after using the artifact by considering all possible digits that can be appended to the prefix.\n12. Update the dp array with the maximum cost of the collection after using the artifact for each prefix of the artifact string A and each possible state of the numbers in Boris' collection.\n13.
