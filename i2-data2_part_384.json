        "instruction": "Recently biologists came to a fascinating conclusion about how to find a chameleon mood. Consider chameleon body to be a rectangular table n \u00d7 m, each cell of which may be green or blue and may change between these two colors. We will denote as (x, y) (1 \u2264 x \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 m) the cell in row x and column y.\n\nLet us define a chameleon good mood certificate to be four cells which are corners of some subrectangle of the table, such that colors in opposite cells among these four are similar, and at the same time not all of the four cell colors are similar. Formally, it is a group of four cells (x_1, y_1), (x_1, y_2), (x_2, y_1), (x_2, y_2) for some 1 \u2264 x_1 < x_2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y_1 < y_2 \u2264 m, that colors of (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) coincide and colors of (x_1, y_2) and (x_2, y_1) coincide, but not all of the four cells share the same color. It was found that whenever such four cells are present, chameleon is in good mood, and vice versa: if there are no such four cells, chameleon is in bad mood.\n\nYou are asked to help scientists write a program determining the mood of chameleon. Let us consider that initially all cells of chameleon are green. After that chameleon coloring may change several times. On one change, colors of contiguous segment of some table row are replaced with the opposite. Formally, each color change is defined by three integers a, l, r (1 \u2264 a \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 m). On such change colors of all cells (a, b) such that l \u2264 b \u2264 r are replaced with the opposite.\n\nWrite a program that reports mood of the chameleon after each change. Additionally, if the chameleon mood is good, program should find out any four numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 such that four cells (x_1, y_1), (x_1, y_2), (x_2, y_1), (x_2, y_2) are the good mood certificate.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers n, m, q (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2000, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 500 000), the sizes of the table and the number of changes respectively. \n\nEach of the following q lines contains 3 integers a_i, l_i, r_i (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 l_i \u2264 r_i \u2264 m), describing i-th coloring change.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q lines. In the i-th line report the chameleon mood after first i color changes for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 q.\n\nIf chameleon is in bad mood, print the only integer -1.\n\nOtherwise, print four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 < x_2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y_1 < y_2 \u2264 m) such that four cells (x_1, y_1), (x_1, y_2), (x_2, y_1), (x_2, y_2) are the good mood certificate. If there are several ways to choose such four integers, print any valid one.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2 2 6\n1 1 1\n2 2 2\n2 1 1\n1 2 2\n2 2 2\n1 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1\n1 1 2 2\n-1\n-1\n-1\n1 1 2 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4 3 9\n2 2 3\n4 1 2\n2 1 3\n3 2 2\n3 1 3\n1 2 2\n4 2 3\n1 1 3\n3 1 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1\n2 1 4 3\n-1\n2 1 3 2\n3 2 4 3\n1 1 2 2\n1 1 2 2\n-1\n2 1 3 2",

Build the segment tree 2: Iterate through the array from left to right and update the segment tree 2. If an element a_i is greater than its index i, mark the range [i, i] as impossible to remove by setting the value at node 1 to n + 1. Otherwise, update the value at node 1 to i - a_i.\n\n4. Build the segment tree: Iterate through the array from right to left and update the segment tree. For each element a_i, find the maximum number of elements that can be removed by querying the segment tree 2. If the minimum value at node 1 of the segment tree 2 is 0, it means that all elements in the current range are impossible to remove, so update the value at node rt[i] to the current maximum number of elements that can be removed.\n\n5. Process the queries: For each query, update the segment tree by setting the values at nodes rt[a + 1] to 0. Then, query the segment tree to find the maximum number of elements that can be removed in the modified range [1, n - b].\n\n6.

Read the initial state of the array from the input string and update the `Data` array accordingly.\n5. Set the first and last elements of the `Data` array to `false`, as they represent the edges of the array and do not have neighbors.\n6. Iterate `m` times to simulate the evolution of the array.\n7. In each iteration, check each cell in the array. If a cell is dead (i.e., `Data[j] == false`) and has exactly one alive neighbor (i.e., `Data[j - 1] == false && Data[j + 1] == true` or `Data[j - 1] == true && Data[j + 1] == false`), mark it for activation by adding its index to the `add` vector.\n8. After checking all cells, activate the marked cells by setting their corresponding elements in the `Data` array to `true`.\n9. If no cells were marked for activation in the current iteration, the evolution process has reached a stable state, and the loop can be terminated.\n10.

Iterate `m` times:\n   - For each cell in the array, check its state and the states of its neighbors.\n   - If the cell is dead and has exactly one alive neighbor, set its state to alive in the list `t`.\n   - Otherwise, set its state to the same as in the original array `s`.\n7. If no cell becomes alive in the current iteration, break the loop.\n8. Update the list `s` with the new state of the array from the list `t`.\n9. After the loop, print the final state of the array as a string of length `n` containing characters \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom io import BytesIO, IOBase\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport math as mt\n\nBUFSIZE = 8192\n\nclass FastIO(IOBase):\n    newlines = 0\n\n    def __init__(self, file):\n        self._fd = file.fileno()\n        self.buffer = BytesIO()\n        self.writable = \"x\" in file.mode or \"r\" not in file.mode\n        self.write = self.buffer.write if self.writable else None\n\n    def read(self):\n        while True:\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\n            if not b:\n                break\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\n        self.newlines = 0\n        return self.buffer.read()\n\n    def readline(self):\n        while self.newlines == 0:\n            b = os.read(self._fd, max(os.fstat(self._fd).st_size, BUFSIZE))\n            self.newlines = b.count(b\"\\n\") + (not b)\n            ptr = self.buffer.tell()\n            self.buffer.seek(0, 2), self.buffer.write(b), self.buffer.seek(ptr)\n        self.newlines -= 1\n        return self.buffer.readline()\n\n    def flush(self):\n        if self.writable:\n            os.write(self._fd, self.buffer.getvalue())\n            self.buffer.truncate(0), self.buffer.seek(0)\n\nclass IOWrapper(IOBase):\n    def __init__(self, file):\n        self.buffer = FastIO(file)\n        self.flush = self.buffer.flush\n        self.writable = self.buffer.writable\n        self.write = lambda s: self.buffer.write(s.encode(\"ascii\"))\n        self.read = lambda: self.buffer.read().decode(\"ascii\")\n        self.readline = lambda: self.buffer.readline().decode(\"ascii\")\n\nsys.stdin, sys.stdout = IOWrapper(sys.stdin), IOWrapper(sys.stdout)\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    if a == 0:\n        return b\n    return gcd(b % a, a)\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return (a * b) / gcd(a, b)\n\nmod = int(1e9) + 7\n\ndef power(k, n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    if n % 2:\n        return (power(k, n -

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input values for N, Q, start, and D, which represent the number of rocks, the number of test cases, the starting rock, and the base jumping distance parameter, respectively.\n2. Read the coordinates of the rocks and store them in the array a.\n3. Initialize the disjoint set data structure to keep track of the connected components of the rocks.\n4. Initialize the minimum jumping distance range for each rock to infinity.\n5. Iterate through the rocks and for each rock, find the closest rocks that are within the jumping distance range (D - k to D + k) in both directions.\n6. If a closer rock is found, update the minimum jumping distance range for the current rock.\n7. Build the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph by connecting the rocks that are within the jumping distance range.\n8. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the MST to calculate the minimum jumping distance range for each rock.\n9. For each test case, check if the minimum jumping distance range for the destination rock is less than or equal to the given jumping distance range k.

The i-th rock is located at an integer coordinate a_i. The coordinates of the rocks are pairwise distinct. The rocks are numbered in the increasing order of the coordinate, so a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n.\n\nA robot frog sits on the rock number s. The frog is programmable. It has a base jumping distance parameter d. There also is a setting for the jumping distance range. If the jumping distance range is set to some integer k, then the frog can jump from some rock to any rock at a distance from d - k to d + k inclusive in any direction. The distance between two rocks is an absolute difference between their coordinates.\n\nYou are assigned a task to implement a feature for the frog. Given two integers i and k determine if the frog can reach a rock number i from a rock number s performing a sequence of jumps with the jumping distance range set to k. The sequence can be arbitrarily long or empty.\n\nYou will be given q testcases for that feature, the j-th testcase consists of two integers i and k. Print \"Yes\" if the i-th rock is reachable and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and 'YES\"' will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers n, q, s and d (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 1 \u2264 s \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of rocks, the number of testcases, the starting rock and the base jumping distance parameter.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the coordinates of the rocks. The coordinates of the rocks are pairwise distinct. The rocks are numbered in the increasing order of distance from the land, so a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers i and k (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the parameters to the testcase.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each of the testcases print an answer.

Thus, it can reach rock number 5 (by jumping 7 to the right) and rock number 3 (by jumping 3 to the left). From rock number 3 it can reach rock number 2 (by jumping 5 to the left). From rock number 2 it can reach rock number 1 (by jumping 4 to the left). However, there is no way to reach rock number 7.\n\nIn the third testcase the frog can jump any distance in the range [5 - 3; 5 + 3]. Thus, it can reach rock number 7 by jumping to rock 5 first and to 7 afterwards.\n\nThe fourth testcase is shown in the explanation for the second testcase.",
