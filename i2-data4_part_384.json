Let's have a look at another specific order: d-sorting. This sorting is applied to the strings of length at least d, where d is some positive integer. The characters of the string are sorted in following manner: first come all the 0-th characters of the initial string, then the 1-st ones, then the 2-nd ones and so on, in the end go all the (d - 1)-th characters of the initial string. By the i-th characters we mean all the character whose positions are exactly i modulo d. If two characters stand on the positions with the same remainder of integer division by d, their relative order after the sorting shouldn't be changed. The string is zero-indexed. For example, for string 'qwerty':\n\nIts 1-sorting is the string 'qwerty' (all characters stand on 0 positions),\n\nIts 2-sorting is the string 'qetwry' (characters 'q', 'e' and 't' stand on 0 positions and characters 'w', 'r' and 'y' are on 1 positions),\n\nIts 3-sorting is the string 'qrwtey' (characters 'q' and 'r' stand on 0 positions, characters 'w' and 't' stand on 1 positions and characters 'e' and 'y' stand on 2 positions),\n\nIts 4-sorting is the string 'qtwyer',\n\nIts 5-sorting is the string 'qywert'.\n\nYou are given string S of length n and m shuffling operations of this string.

Many towns have such tensions that even civil war is possible. \n\nThere are n towns in Reberland, some pairs of which connected by two-way roads. It is not guaranteed that it is possible to reach one town from any other town using these roads. \n\nTowns s and t announce the final break of any relationship and intend to rule out the possibility of moving between them by the roads. Now possibly it is needed to close several roads so that moving from s to t using roads becomes impossible. Each town agrees to spend money on closing no more than one road, therefore, the total number of closed roads will be no more than two.\n\nHelp them find set of no more than two roads such that there will be no way between s and t after closing these roads.

It will randomly follow some shortest path between these two cells. Each possible way is chosen equiprobably.\n\nThe cargo section of the rover contains the battery required to conduct the research. Initially, the battery charge is equal to s units of energy.\n\nSome of the cells contain anomaly. Each time the rover gets to the cell with anomaly, the battery looses half of its charge rounded down. Formally, if the charge was equal to x before the rover gets to the cell with anomaly, the charge will change to <image>.\n\nWhile the rover picks a random shortest path to proceed, compute the expected value of the battery charge after it reaches cell (n, m). If the cells (1, 1) and (n, m) contain anomaly, they also affect the charge of the battery.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains four integers n, m, k and s (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100 000, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 2000, 1 \u2264 s \u2264 1 000 000) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the field, the number of cells with anomaly and the initial charge of the battery respectively.\n\nThe follow k lines containing two integers ri and ci (1 \u2264 ri \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 ci \u2264 m) \u2014 coordinates of the cells, containing anomaly. It's guaranteed that each cell appears in this list no more than once.\n\nOutput\n\nThe answer can always be represented as an irreducible fraction <image>.

Prices in the canteen do not change and that means Arseny will spend ci rubles during the i-th day.\n\nThere are 1-ruble coins and 100-ruble notes in circulation. At this moment, Arseny has m coins and a sufficiently large amount of notes (you can assume that he has an infinite amount of them). Arseny loves modern technologies, so he uses his credit card everywhere except the canteen, but he has to pay in cash in the canteen because it does not accept cards.\n\nCashier always asks the student to pay change-free. However, it's not always possible, but Arseny tries to minimize the dissatisfaction of the cashier. Cashier's dissatisfaction for each of the days is determined by the total amount of notes and coins in the change. To be precise, if the cashier gives Arseny x notes and coins on the i-th day, his dissatisfaction for this day equals x\u00b7wi. Cashier always gives change using as little coins and notes as possible, he always has enough of them to be able to do this.\n\n<image> \"Caution!

Perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree, starting from an arbitrary root vertex (in this case, vertex 1). The DFS function returns a vector of pairs, where each pair contains the minimum number of jumps required to reach a vertex from the current vertex and the number of vertices reachable within the current jump distance.\n4. During the DFS traversal, for each vertex, calculate the minimum number of jumps required to reach all its children and update the corresponding values in the vector of pairs.\n5. After the DFS traversal, calculate the total sum of f(s, t) over all pairs of vertices (s, t) such that s < t by iterating through the vector of pairs and applying the formula provided in the problem statement.\n6.

The image must be compressible in that state.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input will contain two integers n, m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2 500), the dimensions of the image.\n\nThe next n lines of input will contain a binary string with exactly m characters, representing the image.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer, the minimum number of pixels needed to toggle to make the image compressible.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n3 5\n00100\n10110\n11001\n\n\nOutput\n\n5\n\nNote\n\nWe first choose k = 2.\n\nThe image is padded as follows: \n    \n    \n      \n    001000  \n    101100  \n    110010  \n    000000  \n    \n\nWe can toggle the image to look as follows: \n    \n    \n      \n    001100  \n    001100  \n    000000  \n    000000  \n    \n\nWe can see that this image is compressible for k = 2.",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. First, we need to find all possible block sizes (k) that can divide the image dimensions (n and m). We use a technique called \"prime factorization\" to generate these block sizes. We start with a list of prime numbers and multiply them to generate all possible block sizes.\n2. Next, we iterate over each block size (k) and pad the image with zeros to make its dimensions divisible by k. We then calculate the number of pixels that need to be toggled to make the image compressible for this block size.\n3. To calculate the number of pixels to toggle, we iterate over each block and count the number of pixels that need to be changed to make all pixels in the block have the same value. We use a 2D array (aa) to store the count of pixels with value '1' in each block.\n4. We iterate over each block and calculate the minimum number of pixels to toggle to make all pixels in the block have the same value. We use the formula min(aa[j][k], block_size - aa[j][k]) to calculate this.\n5. We keep track of the minimum number of pixels to toggle across all block sizes and print this value as the final answer.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to find all possible block sizes (k) that can divide the image dimensions (n and m)\nvoid find_block_sizes(int m, int n, int b[]) {\n  int i, j, k, sl;\n  sl = 0;\n  memset(b, 0, sizeof(b));\n  for (i = 2; i < 2505; i++) {\n    if (b[i] == 0) {\n      b[sl++] = i;\n    }\n    for (j = 0; j < sl && i * b[j] < 2505; j++) {\n      b[i * b[j]] = 1;\n      if (i % b[j] == 0) break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int i, j, k, sl;\n  int m, n, t, mm, nn, tt, d, dd, e, ee;\n  int b[2505]; // array to store block sizes\n\n  // Find all possible block sizes\n  find_block_sizes(2500, 2500, b);\n\n  while (~scanf(\"%d%d\", &m, &n)) {\n    int c[2505][2505]; // 2D array to store image pixels\n    int aa[2505][2505]; // 2D array to store count of pixels with value '1' in each block\n\n    // Read image pixels\n    for (i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n      scanf(\"%s\", &c[i]);\n    }\n\n    // Initialize minimum number of pixels to toggle\n    t = INT_MAX;\n\n    // Iterate over each block size\n    for (i = 0; b[i] * b[i] <= m * n; i++) {\n      memset(aa, 0, sizeof(aa));\n      tt = 0;\n      int bb = b[i] * b[i]; // block size squared\n\n      // Count pixels with value '1' in each block\n      for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n        for (k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n          if (c[j][k] == '0') {\n            d = j / b[i];\n            e = k / b[i];\n            aa[d][e]++;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n\n      // Calculate minimum number of pixels to toggle for this block size\n      d = (m - 1) / b[i];\n      e = (n - 1) / b[i];\n      dd = d * b[i];\n      ee = e * b[i];\n\n      for (j = 0; j <= d; j++) {\n        for (k = 0; k <= e; k++) {\n          if (j!= d && k!= e) {\n            tt += min(aa[j][k], bb - aa[j][k]);\n          } else {\n            if (j!= d && k == e) aa[j][k] += bb - b[i] * (n - ee);\n            if (j == d && k!= e) aa[j][k] += bb - b[i] * (m - dd);\n            if (j == d && k == e) aa[j][k] += bb - (m - dd) * (n - ee);\n            tt += min(aa[j][k], bb - aa[j][k]);\n          }\n        }\n      }\n\n      // Update minimum number of pixels to toggle\n      t = min(t, tt);\n    }\n\n    // Print minimum number of pixels to toggle\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", t);\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

        "instruction": "The mayor of the Berland city S sees the beauty differently than other city-dwellers. In particular, he does not understand at all, how antique houses can be nice-looking. So the mayor wants to demolish all ancient buildings in the city.\n\nThe city S is going to host the football championship very soon. In order to make the city beautiful, every month the Berland government provides mayor a money tranche. The money has to be spent on ancient buildings renovation.\n\nThere are n months before the championship and the i-th month tranche equals to ai burles. The city S has m antique buildings and the renovation cost of the j-th building is bj burles.\n\nThe mayor has his own plans for spending the money. As he doesn't like antique buildings he wants to demolish as much of them as possible. For the j-th building he calculated its demolishing cost pj.\n\nThe mayor decided to act according to the following plan.\n\nEach month he chooses several (possibly zero) of m buildings to demolish in such a way that renovation cost of each of them separately is not greater than the money tranche ai of this month (bj \u2264 ai) \u2014 it will allow to deceive city-dwellers that exactly this building will be renovated.\n\nThen the mayor has to demolish all selected buildings during the current month as otherwise the dwellers will realize the deception and the plan will fail. Definitely the total demolishing cost can not exceed amount of money the mayor currently has. The mayor is not obliged to spend all the money on demolishing. If some money is left, the mayor puts it to the bank account and can use it in any subsequent month. Moreover, at any month he may choose not to demolish any buildings at all (in this case all the tranche will remain untouched and will be saved in the bank).\n\nYour task is to calculate the maximal number of buildings the mayor can demolish.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of months before the championship and the number of ancient buildings in the city S.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 109), where ai is the tranche of the i-th month.\n\nThe third line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 \u2264 bj \u2264 109), where bj is renovation cost of the j-th building.\n\nThe fourth line contains m integers p1, p2, ..., pm (1 \u2264 pj \u2264 109), where pj is the demolishing cost of the j-th building.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput single integer \u2014 the maximal number of buildings the mayor can demolish.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 3\n2 4\n6 2 3\n1 3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n3 5\n5 3 1\n5 2 9 1 10\n4 2 1 3 10\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n5 6\n6 3 2 4 3\n3 6 4 5 4 2\n1 4 3 2 5 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n6\n\nNote\n\nIn the third example the mayor acts as follows.\n\nIn the first month he obtains 6 burles tranche and demolishes buildings #2 (renovation cost 6, demolishing cost 4) and #4 (renovation cost 5, demolishing cost 2). He spends all the money on it.\n\nAfter getting the second month tranche of 3 burles, the mayor selects only building #1 (renovation cost 3, demolishing cost 1) for demolishing. As a result, he saves 2 burles for the next months.\n\nIn the third month he gets 2 burle tranche, but decides not to demolish any buildings at all. As a result, he has 2 + 2 = 4 burles in the bank.\n\nThis reserve will be spent on the fourth month together with the 4-th tranche for demolishing of houses #3 and #5 (renovation cost is 4 for each, demolishing costs are 3 and 5 correspondingly). After this month his budget is empty.\n\nFinally, after getting the last tranche of 3 burles, the mayor demolishes building #6 (renovation cost 2, demolishing cost 3).\n\nAs it can be seen, he demolished all 6 buildings.",

The radix sum of several integers is defined as follows: s(t_1, \u2026 ,t_n)=s(t_1,s(t_2, \u2026 ,t_n))\n\nYou are given an array x_1, \u2026 ,x_n.

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n\n1. Read the input: The first line contains the integer n, which represents the length of the array. The second line contains n integers x_1, \u2026, x_n, which are the elements of the array.\n2. Initialize the x array: Create a Ring structure for each element in the array and set the value of the Ring structure at index x_i to 1, representing the occurrence of x_i in the array.\n3. Define the f and g arrays: The f array stores the remainder of the sum of two digits modulo 5, and the g array stores the value of 1 if the sum of two digits is less than 5, and -1 otherwise.\n4. Perform the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the x array: The FFT is used to efficiently compute the discrete Fourier transform of the x array. The FFT is performed in two stages: the first stage is a divide-and-conquer approach that splits the array into smaller subarrays, and the second stage is a butterfly step that combines the results of the subarrays.\n5. Compute the power of each Ring structure: Raise each Ring structure to the power of n, which represents the number of times the integers are chosen.\n6. Perform the inverse FFT on the x array: The inverse FFT is used to efficiently compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the x array.\n7. Compute the real part of each Ring structure: Extract the real part of each Ring structure, which represents the number of ways to choose the integers.\n8. Compute the final result: Multiply the real part of each Ring structure by the inverse of 5 raised to the power of 58 and take the result modulo 2^58.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nusing INT = unsigned long long;\nconst int N = 100000;\n\n// Define the Ring structure to represent a number modulo 2^58\nstruct Ring {\n  INT a[5]; // Store the coefficients of the number\n  Ring() {} // Default constructor\n  void clear() { // Clear the coefficients\n    memset(a, 0, sizeof a);\n  }\n  Ring operator+(Ring r) { // Add two Ring structures\n    Ring R = r;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) R.a[i] += a[i];\n    return R;\n  }\n  void operator+=(Ring r) { (*this) = (*this) + r; } // Add two Ring structures in-place\n  Ring operator*(Ring r) { // Multiply two Ring structures\n    Ring R;\n    R.clear();\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)\n      for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {\n        R.a[f[i + j]] += a[i] * r.a[j] * g[i + j];\n      }\n    return R;\n  }\n  void operator*=(Ring r) { (*this) = (*this) * r; } // Multiply two Ring structures in-place\n  Ring operator<<(int k) { // Shift the Ring structure to the left\n    Ring R;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) R.a[f[i + k]] = a[i] * g[i + k];\n    return R;\n  }\n  INT real() { // Extract the real part of the Ring structure\n    return a[0] + a[1];\n  }\n} x[N], tmp[10]; // Create an array of Ring structures to store the input numbers\n\n// Define the f and g arrays to store the remainder of the sum of two digits modulo 5 and the value of 1 or -1\nint f[11111], g[11111];\n\n// Define the power function to compute the power of a number modulo 2^58\nINT power(INT a, INT n, INT ans = 1) {\n  for (; n; n >>= 1, a *= a)\n    if (n & 1) ans *= a;\n  return ans;\n}\n\n// Define the power function for Ring structures\nRing power(Ring a, INT n) {\n  Ring ans;\n  ans.clear();\n  ans.a[0] = 1;\n  for (; n; n >>= 1, a *= a)\n    if (n & 1) ans *= a;\n  return ans;\n}\n\n// Define the DFT function to perform the Fast Fourier Transform\nvoid DFT(Ring *P, int op) {\n  for (int i = 1; i < N; i *= 10) {\n    for (int p = i * 10, j = 0; j < N; j += p) {\n      for (int k = 0; k < i; k++) {\n        for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) tmp[x] = P[j + k + x * i];\n        for (int x = 0, t = 0; x < 10; x++, t += op) {\n          Ring &r = P[j + k + x * i];\n          r.clear();\n          for (int y = 0, d = 0; y < 10; y++, d += t) r += tmp[y] << d;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  memset(x, 0, sizeof x); // Clear the x array\n  scanf(\"%d\", &n); // Read the input length\n  for (int i = 0, k; i < n; i++) {\n    scanf(\"%d\", &k); // Read the input numbers\n    x[k].a[0]++; // Increment the coefficient of the Ring structure at index k\n  }\n  for (int i = 0; i < 1111; i++) f[i] = i % 5, g[i] = i % 10 < 5? 1 : -1; // Initialize the f and g arrays\n  DFT(x, 1); // Perform the FFT on the x array\n  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) x[i] = power(x[i], n); // Compute the power of each Ring structure\n  DFT(x, 9); // Perform the inverse FFT on the x array\n  INT inv = power(5, (1ull << 63) - 5); // Compute the inverse of 5 raised to the power of 58\n  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n    printf(\"%I64d\\n\", (x[i].real() >> 5) * inv & ((1ull << 58) - 1)); // Compute and print the final result\n}\n```",
