For better understanding, Nam decided to learn it a few days before the lesson.\n\nNam created a sequence a consisting of n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) elements a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 105). A subsequence ai1, ai2, ..., aik where 1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < ... < ik \u2264 n is called increasing if ai1 < ai2 < ai3 < ... < aik. An increasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing subsequences. \n\nNam realizes that a sequence may have several longest increasing subsequences. Hence, he divides all indexes i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), into three groups:\n\n  1. group of all i such that ai belongs to no longest increasing subsequences.\n  2. group of all i such that ai belongs to at least one but not every longest increasing subsequence.\n  3. group of all i such that ai belongs to every longest increasing subsequence. \n\n\n\nSince the number of longest increasing subsequences of a may be very large, categorizing process is very difficult.

        "instruction": "Limak is a little polar bear. He plays by building towers from blocks. Every block is a cube with positive integer length of side. Limak has infinitely many blocks of each side length.\n\nA block with side a has volume a3. A tower consisting of blocks with sides a1, a2, ..., ak has the total volume a13 + a23 + ... + ak3.\n\nLimak is going to build a tower. First, he asks you to tell him a positive integer X \u2014 the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak adds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such that the total volume doesn't exceed X.\n\nLimak asks you to choose X not greater than m. Also, he wants to maximize the number of blocks in the tower at the end (however, he still behaves greedily). Secondarily, he wants to maximize X.\n\nCan you help Limak? Find the maximum number of blocks his tower can have and the maximum X \u2264 m that results this number of blocks.\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of the input contains one integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 1015), meaning that Limak wants you to choose X between 1 and m, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint two integers \u2014 the maximum number of blocks in the tower and the maximum required total volume X, resulting in the maximum number of blocks.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n48\n\n\nOutput\n\n9 42\n\n\nInput\n\n6\n\n\nOutput\n\n6 6\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample test, there will be 9 blocks if you choose X = 23 or X = 42. Limak wants to maximize X secondarily so you should choose 42.\n\nIn more detail, after choosing X = 42 the process of building a tower is:\n\n  * Limak takes a block with side 3 because it's the biggest block with volume not greater than 42. The remaining volume is 42 - 27 = 15. \n  * The second added block has side 2, so the remaining volume is 15 - 8 = 7. \n  * Finally, Limak adds 7 blocks with side 1, one by one. \n\n\n\nSo, there are 9 blocks in the tower.

A move is considered as removal of some number of stones from a pile. Removal of 0 stones does not count as a move.\n  * The player who is unable to make a move loses.\n\n\n\nNow Jon believes that he is ready for battle, but Sam does not think so. To prove his argument, Sam suggested that they play a modified version of the game.\n\nIn this modified version, no move can be made more than once on a pile.

        "instruction": "T is a complete binary tree consisting of n vertices. It means that exactly one vertex is a root, and each vertex is either a leaf (and doesn't have children) or an inner node (and has exactly two children). All leaves of a complete binary tree have the same depth (distance from the root). So n is a number such that n + 1 is a power of 2.\n\nIn the picture you can see a complete binary tree with n = 15.\n\n<image>\n\nVertices are numbered from 1 to n in a special recursive way: we recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the left subtree (if current vertex is not a leaf), then assign a number to the current vertex, and then recursively assign numbers to all vertices from the right subtree (if it exists). In the picture vertices are numbered exactly using this algorithm. It is clear that for each size of a complete binary tree exists exactly one way to give numbers to all vertices. This way of numbering is called symmetric.\n\nYou have to write a program that for given n answers q queries to the tree.\n\nEach query consists of an integer number ui (1 \u2264 ui \u2264 n) and a string si, where ui is the number of vertex, and si represents the path starting from this vertex. String si doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U', which mean traverse to the left child, to the right child and to the parent, respectively. Characters from si have to be processed from left to right, considering that ui is the vertex where the path starts. If it's impossible to process a character (for example, to go to the left child of a leaf), then you have to skip it. The answer is the number of vertex where the path represented by si ends.\n\nFor example, if ui = 4 and si = \u00abUURL\u00bb, then the answer is 10.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1018, q \u2265 1). n is such that n + 1 is a power of 2.\n\nThe next 2q lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines. The first of these two lines contains ui (1 \u2264 ui \u2264 n), the second contains non-empty string si. si doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U'.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of si (for each i such that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 q) doesn't exceed 105.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q numbers, i-th number must be the answer to the i-th query.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n15 2\n4\nUURL\n8\nLRLLLLLLLL\n\n\nOutput\n\n10\n5",

If z is a valid vertex, update x to z.\n   - If the operation is 'L', subtract the lowest bit of x from x to move to the left child.\n   - If the operation is 'R', add the lowest bit of x to x to move to the right child.\n7.

In total there are 26 possible colors of puppies in the nature and they are denoted by letters from 'a' to 'z' inclusive.\n\nThe committee rules strictly prohibit even the smallest diversity between doggos and hence all the puppies should be of the same color. Thus Slava, the committee employee, has been assigned the task to recolor some puppies into other colors in order to eliminate the difference and make all the puppies have one common color.\n\nUnfortunately, due to bureaucratic reasons and restricted budget, there's only one operation Slava can perform: he can choose a color x such that there are currently at least two puppies of color x and recolor all puppies of the color x into some arbitrary color y. Luckily, this operation can be applied multiple times (including zero).\n\nFor example, if the number of puppies is 7 and their colors are represented as the string \"abababc\", then in one operation Slava can get the results \"zbzbzbc\", \"bbbbbbc\", \"aaaaaac\", \"acacacc\" and others. However, if the current color sequence is \"abababc\", then he can't choose x='c' right now, because currently only one puppy has the color 'c'.\n\nHelp Slava and the committee determine whether it is possible to standardize all the puppies, i.e. after Slava's operations all the puppies should have the same color.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of puppies.\n\nThe second line contains a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where the i-th symbol denotes the i-th puppy's color.\n\nOutput\n\nIf it's possible to recolor all puppies into one color, print \"Yes\".\n\nOtherwise print \"No\".\n\nOutput the answer without quotation signs.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n6\naabddc\n\n\nOutput\n\nYes\n\n\nInput\n\n3\nabc\n\n\nOutput\n\nNo\n\n\nInput\n\n3\njjj\n\n\nOutput\n\nYes\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example Slava can perform the following steps: \n\n  1. take all puppies of color 'a' (a total of two) and recolor them into 'b'; \n  2. take all puppies of color 'd' (a total of two) and recolor them into 'c'; \n  3. take all puppies of color 'b' (three puppies for now) and recolor them into 'c'. \n\n\n\nIn the second example it's impossible to recolor any of the puppies.\n\nIn the third example all the puppies' colors are the same; thus there's no need to recolor anything.",
