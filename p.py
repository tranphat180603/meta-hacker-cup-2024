def analyze_original_test_cases_template(problem_description):
    return f"""
    Task: Based on the problem description: '{problem_description}', your job is to analyze the original test case input and output, map each component to its corresponding variable from the problem description, and explain how these inputs lead to the specified output based on the logic and constraints of the problem.
    
    You should start by identifying the format of the test cases and specifying the structure of the input and output.
    
    **Clarification about Input Structure**:
    - The input may consist of multiple test cases, and for each test case, variables can appear on the same line or different lines.
    - If multiple values are provided across multiple lines, clearly specify how the input is structured line by line.
    - Ensure the separation of input components is maintained based on their appearance on separate lines.
    
    **General Example**:
    - Input:
      3 (number of test cases)
      Test Case 1:
        Line 1: N, K (e.g., 4 17)
        Line 2: traveler_1 time (e.g., 1)
        Line 3: traveler_2 time (e.g., 2)
        ...
      Test Case 2: values or variables as per the problem
      ...

    - Output:
      Expected output format specified by the problem (e.g., Case #1: YES, result values, etc.).

    **Guidelines**:
    1. Write clear comments: Add detailed comments throughout the code to explain each part of the logic.
    2. The input format must strictly follow the structure described in the test cases. For example, if the test input is provided in multiple lines, make sure your code can handle it line by line.
