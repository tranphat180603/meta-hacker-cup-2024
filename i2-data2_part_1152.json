One day, they decided to invent their own simplified version of this game \u2014 2k on a stripe.\n\nImagine an infinite in one direction stripe, consisting of unit squares (the side of each square is equal to the height of the stripe). Each square can either be empty or contain some number.\n\nInitially, all squares are empty. Then at infinity one of the unit squares number 2 or 4 appears. Then the player presses a button once, and the appeared number begins to move towards the beginning of the stripe. Let's assume that some number x moves to the beginning of the stripe, then it will stop if:\n\n  1. it either gets in the first square of the stripe; \n  2. or it is in the square that is preceded by a square with number y (y \u2260 x). But if number x at some point of time gets to the square with the same number then both numbers add to each other and result in 2x. The new number 2x continues moving to the beginning of the stripe by the same rules. \n\n\n\nAfter the final stop of the number moving process, the infinity gets a new number 2 or 4 and the process repeats. Read the notes to the test samples to better understand the moving strategy.\n\nI guess you've understood that the game progress fully depends on the order in which numbers 2 and 4 appear. Let's look at some sequence of numbers 2 and 4 in the game. We assume that the sequence is winning if it results in at least one square getting the number greater or equal than 2k. \n\nThe goal of the game is to make up a winning sequence of n numbers. But not everything is so simple, some numbers in the sequence are identified beforehand. You are given a sequence consisting of numbers 0, 2, 4. Count how many ways there are to replace each 0 of the sequence with 2 or 4 to get a winning sequence.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000; 3 \u2264 k \u2264 11).

There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers: h, w, n \u2014 the sides of the board and the number of black cells (1 \u2264 h, w \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000). \n\nNext n lines contain the description of black cells. The i-th of these lines contains numbers ri, ci (1 \u2264 ri \u2264 h, 1 \u2264 ci \u2264 w) \u2014 the number of the row and column of the i-th cell.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the upper left and lower right cell are white and all cells in the description are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line \u2014 the remainder of the number of ways to move Gerald's pawn from the upper left to the lower right corner modulo 109 + 7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3 4 2\n2 2\n2 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n100 100 3\n15 16\n16 15\n99 88\n\n\nOutput\n\n545732279",

He will eat all your cookies unless you can demonstrate your mathematical skills. To test you, Limak is going to give you a puzzle to solve.\n\nIt's a well-known fact that Limak, as every bear, owns a set of numbers. You know some information about the set:\n\n  * The elements of the set are distinct positive integers. \n  * The number of elements in the set is n. The number n is divisible by 5. \n  * All elements are between 1 and b, inclusive: bears don't know numbers greater than b. \n  * For each r in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, the set contains exactly <image> elements that give remainder r when divided by 5. (That is, there are <image> elements divisible by 5, <image> elements of the form 5k + 1, <image> elements of the form 5k + 2, and so on.) \n\n\n\nLimak smiles mysteriously and gives you q hints about his set. The i-th hint is the following sentence: \"If you only look at elements that are between 1 and upToi, inclusive, you will find exactly quantityi such elements in my set.\"\n\nIn a moment Limak will tell you the actual puzzle, but something doesn't seem right... That smile was very strange. You start to think about a possible reason. Maybe Limak cheated you? Or is he a fair grizzly bear?\n\nGiven n, b, q and hints, check whether Limak can be fair, i.e. there exists at least one set satisfying the given conditions. If it's possible then print ''fair\". Otherwise, print ''unfair\".\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, b and q (5 \u2264 n \u2264 b \u2264 104, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 104, n divisible by 5) \u2014 the size of the set, the upper limit for numbers in the set and the number of hints.\n\nThe next q lines describe the hints.

Initialize an array Q to store the hints, where each hint is represented as a pair of integers (upToi, quantityi).\n3. Add two additional hints to Q: (0, 0) and (b, n). These hints represent the range from 0 to 0 and from b to n, respectively.\n4. Sort the hints in Q based on the upToi value.\n5. Iterate through the sorted hints and check if the quantityi value is less than the quantityi value of the previous hint or if the difference between the quantityi values is greater than the difference between the upToi values. If either condition is true, it means that the hints are inconsistent, and the program prints \"unfair\" and exits.\n6. Iterate through all possible subsets S of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} (i.e., all possible values of S from 1 to 2^K - 1).\n7. For each subset S, calculate the total number of elements t that need to be added to the set to satisfy the hints.\n8. For each hint, calculate the number of elements b that satisfy the hint based on the subset S.\n9. If the number of elements b is less than the quantityi value of the hint, add the difference to t.\n10.

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input: The first step is to read the number of strings `n` and the strings themselves from the input.\n2. Preprocess the strings: Convert each string into a sequence of characters and store them in an array `s`.\n3. Build the SAM (Suffix Automaton) data structure: Use the strings to build the SAM data structure, which will be used to efficiently compute the cyclic shifts of the strings.\n4. Compute the cyclic shifts: Use the SAM data structure to compute the cyclic shifts of the strings and store them in an array `nd`.\n5. Build the graph: Build a graph where each node represents a string and each edge represents a cyclic shift between two strings.\n6. Perform topological sorting: Perform a topological sorting on the graph to find all the valid cyclic shifts.\n7. Count the valid sublists: Count the number of valid sublists by iterating over all possible sublists and checking if they are valid using the topological sorting result.\n8. Output the result: Output the total count of valid sublists.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int N = 35, M = 200010 + N;\nchar s[N][M];\nint len[N], n;\nstruct edge {\n  int to, pre;\n} e[M << 1];\nint u[M << 1], l = 0;\nnamespace SAM {\n// Build the SAM data structure\nvoid ins(int a, int b) { e[++l] = (edge){b, u[a]}, u[a] = l; }\nstruct node {\n  node *trans[26], *par;\n  int l;\n} T[M << 1], *S = &T[1];\nint tl = 1;\nnode *nn() { return &T[++tl]; }\nnode *add(node *p, int x) {\n  // Add a new node to the SAM data structure\n  node *w = p;\n  if (w->trans[x] && w->trans[x]->l == w->l + 1) return w->trans[x];\n  p = nn(), p->l = w->l + 1;\n  for (; w &&!w->trans[x]; w = w->par) w->trans[x] = p;\n  if (!w)\n    p->par = S;\n  else {\n    node *q = w->trans[x];\n    if (q->l == w->l + 1)\n      p->par = q;\n    else {\n      node *r = nn();\n      *r = *q;\n      r->l = w->l + 1;\n      for (; w && w->trans[x] == q; w = w->par) w->trans[x] = r;\n      p->par = q->par = r;\n    }\n  }\n  return p;\n}\nnode *nd[N][M];\nint pre[M << 1], ed[M << 1], dfn = 0, ind[N];\n// Perform DFS on the SAM data structure\nvoid dfs(int x, int f) {\n  pre[x] = ++dfn;\n  for (int i = u[x]; i; i = e[i].pre)\n    if (e[i].to!= f) dfs(e[i].to, x);\n  ed[x] = dfn;\n}\n// Build the SAM data structure\nvoid build() {\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) nd[i][len[i] + 1] = S, ind[i] = len[i];\n  for (int k = 1; k <= 100000; k++)\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)\n      if (ind[i]) {\n        int j = ind[i];\n        nd[i][j] = add(nd[i][j + 1], s[i][j] - 'a');\n        ind[i]--;\n      }\n  for (int i = 1; i <= tl; i++)\n    if (T[i].par) ins(T[i].par - T, i);\n  dfs(1, 0);\n}\n// Check if a string is a subtree of another string\nbool subtree(int x, int y) {\n  bool ans = (pre[x] <= pre[y]) && (pre[y] <= ed[x]);\n  return ans;\n}\n}  // namespace SAM\nnamespace Graph {\n// Build the graph\nedge e[M * N];\nint u[M], l, d[M];\nvoid ins(int a, int b) {\n  d[b]++;\n  e[++l] = (edge){b, u[a]}, u[a] = l;\n}\n// Initialize the graph\nvoid init() { memset(u, 0, sizeof(u)), l = 0, memset(d, 0, sizeof(d)); }\nint s[N];\nint L;\n// Build the graph for a given range\nvoid build(int l, int r) {\n  s[l] = 0;\n  for (int i = l; i <= r - 1; i++) s[i + 1] = s[i] + len[i] + 1;\n  L = s[r] + len[r] + 1;\n  for (int i = l; i <= r; i++)\n    for (int j = 1; j <= len[i] + 1; j++) {\n      int x = s[i] + j;\n      for (int k = l; k <= r; k++)\n        if (j!= 1 || len[k]!= len[i]) {\n          if (len[k] < len[i] - j + 1) {\n            if (SAM::subtree(SAM::nd[k][1] - SAM::T, SAM::nd[i][j] - SAM::T))\n              ins(x, s[i] + j + len[k]);\n          } else {\n            if (SAM::subtree(SAM::nd[i][j] - SAM::T, SAM::nd[k][1] - SAM::T))\n              ins(x, s[k] + (len[i] - j + 1) + 1);\n          }\n        }\n    }\n}\nint q[M];\n// Perform topological sorting on the graph\nbool sort() {\n  int l = 0, r = 0;\n  for (int i = 1; i <= L; i++)\n    if (!d[i]) q[r++] = i;\n  while (l < r) {\n    int x = q[l++];\n    for (int i = u[x]; i; i = e[i].pre) {\n      d[e[i].to]--;\n      if (!d[e[i].to]) q[r++] = e[i].to;\n    }\n  }\n  for (int i = 1; i <= L; i++)\n    if (d[i]) return false;\n  return true;\n}\n}  // namespace Graph\n// Check if a sublist is valid\nbool check(int l, int r) {\n  if (l > r) return true;\n  Graph::init();\n  Graph::build(l, r);\n  return Graph::sort();\n}\nint main() {\n  scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) scanf(\"%s\", s[i] + 1), len[i] = strlen(s[i] + 1);\n  SAM::build();\n  int ans = 0;\n  for (int l = 1, r = 0; l <= n; l++) {\n    while (r + 1 <= n && check(l, r + 1)) r++;\n    ans += r - l + 1;\n  }\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

If n is even, use dynamic programming to calculate the number of strings that Alice can win with. This involves calculating the number of ways to arrange and delete characters in the string to create a unique string that Bob cannot win with.\n4. Initialize a 2D array f to store the number of ways to create a string of length i with k unique characters, where i ranges from 0 to n.\n5. Use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to efficiently calculate the values in the f array.\n6. After calculating the f array, use it to determine the number of strings that Alice can win with by subtracting the number of strings that Bob can win with from the total number of possible strings.\n7. Print the final answer, which is the number of strings that Alice can win with modulo P.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to update the maximum value of x with y\ntemplate <typename T>\ninline bool chkmax(T &x, const T &y) {\n  return x < y? x = y, 1 : 0;\n}\n\n// Function to update the minimum value of x with y\ntemplate <typename T>\ninline bool chkmin(T &x, const T &y) {\n  return x > y? x = y, 1 : 0;\n}\n\n// Function to read an integer from input\ntemplate <typename T>\ninline T geti() {\n  register T xi = 0;\n  register char ch = getchar();\n  bool f = 0;\n  while (!isdigit(ch)) ch == '-'? f = 1 : f, ch = getchar();\n  while (isdigit(ch)) xi = xi * 10 + ch - 48, ch = getchar();\n  return f? -xi : xi;\n}\n\n// Function to print an integer\ntemplate <typename T>\ninline void pi(T k, char ch = 0) {\n  if (k < 0) k = -k, putchar('-');\n  if (k >= 10) pi(k / 10);\n  putchar(k % 10 + '0');\n  if (ch) putchar(ch);\n}\n\n// Define constants\nconst int N = 3e5 + 10;\nint P = 1e9 + 9;\n\n// Function to calculate the power of a number modulo P\ninline long long fpow(long long a, int b, long long c = 1) {\n  for (; b; b >>= 1, a = a * a % P)\n    if (b & 1) c = c * a % P;\n  return c;\n}\n\n// Function to initialize factorials and their inverses\ninline void init(int n) {\n  fac[0] = 1;\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) fac[i] = 1ll * fac[i - 1] * i % P;\n  ifac[n] = fpow(fac[n], P - 2);\n  for (int i = n - 1; ~i; --i) ifac[i] = ifac[i + 1] * (i + 1ll) % P;\n  inv[1] = 1;\n  for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) inv[i] = 1ll * (P - P / i) * inv[P % i] % P;\n}\n\n// Function to add two numbers modulo P\ninline void add(int &x, int y) {\n  x += y;\n  if (x >= P) x -= P;\n}\n\n// Function to subtract two numbers modulo P\ninline void sub(int &x, int y) {\n  x -= y;\n  x -= (x >> 31) * P;\n}\n\n// Function to subtract a number from 0 modulo P\ninline int sub(int x) { return x - (x >> 31) * P; }\n\n// Function to calculate the power of a polynomial using FFT\ninline void fpow(int *f, int n, int k) {\n  memcpy(t, f, 4 * n + 4);\n  f[0] = 1 - f[0], g[0] = 0;\n  for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n    f[i] = g[i] = 0;\n    for (int j = 1; j < i; ++j)\n      f[i] = (f[i] + 1ll * f[i - j] * g[j]) % P,\n      g[i] = (g[i] + 1ll * t[i - j] * g[j]) % P;\n    sub(f[i], g[i]);\n    f[i] = (t[i] + 1ll * f[i] * inv[i]) % P * k % P,\n    g[i] = (t[i] - 1ll * g[i] * inv[i]) % P * i % P;\n  }\n}\n\n// Function to perform the inverse FFT\ninline void IFMT(int *f, int n) {\n  for (int l = 1; l < n; l <<= 1)\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += l << 1)\n      for (register int j = 0; j < l; ++j) sub(f[i + j + l], f[i + j]);\n}\n\n// Function to perform the forward FFT\ninline void FMT(int *f, int n) {\n  for (int l = 1; l < n; l <<= 1)\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += l << 1)\n      for (register int j = 0; j < l; ++j) add(f[i + j + l], f[i + j]);\n}\n\n// Main function\nint main(void) {\n  // Read input values\n  n = geti<int>(), k = geti<int>();\n  P = geti<int>();\n\n  // Initialize answer\n  int ans = fpow(k, n);\n\n  // If n is even, calculate the number of strings that Alice can win with\n  if (~n & 1) {\n    int m = (int)log2(n) + 1;\n    init(1 << m);\n\n    // Initialize f array\n    for (int i = 0; i < (1 << m); ++i) f[__builtin_popcount(i)][i] = ifac[i];\n\n    // Perform FFT to calculate f array\n    for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i) FMT(f[i], 1 << m);\n\n    // Calculate the number of strings that Alice can win with\n    static int F[20];\n    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {\n      for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) F[j] = f[j][i];\n      fpow(F, m + 1, k);\n      for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j) f[j][i] = F[j];\n    }\n\n    // Perform inverse FFT to calculate f array\n    IFMT(f[__builtin_popcount(n)], 1 << m);\n\n    // Update answer\n    ans = (P + ans - 1ll * f[__builtin_popcount(n)][n] * fac[n] % P) % P;\n  }\n\n  // Print answer\n  pi(ans);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

Create the graph: The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each city is a node, and the roads are represented as edges between the nodes. The graph is stored in the `g_orig` array.\n3. Find the roots: The roots are the nodes that are not visited yet. These nodes are the starting points for the DFS traversal.\n4. Perform DFS: The DFS traversal is performed from each root node. The DFS function `make_tree` is used to traverse the graph and build the tree structure.\n5. Build the tree: The tree structure is built by recursively calling the `make_tree` function from each node. The tree structure is stored in the `g_tree` array.\n6. Find the back edges: The back edges are the edges that point from a node to one of its ancestors. These edges are stored in the `g_back` array.\n7. Perform DFS on the back edges: The DFS function `dfs` is used to traverse the back edges and build the episodes.\n8.

The capital has n houses on a straight line numbered from 1 (leftmost) to n (rightmost), and the distance between any two neighboring houses is the same.\n\nYou have to help the company schedule all the taxi rides which come throughout the day according to the following rules: \n\n  * All cars are available for picking up passengers. Initially the j-th car is located next to the house with the number xj at time 0. \n  * All cars have the same speed. It takes exactly 1 minute for any car to travel between neighboring houses i and i + 1. \n  * The i-th request for taxi ride comes at the time ti, asking for a passenger to be picked up at the house ai and dropped off at the house bi. All requests for taxi rides are given in the increasing order of ti. All ti are distinct. \n\n\n\nWhen a request for taxi ride is received at time ti, Berland.Taxi operator assigns a car to it as follows: \n\n  * Out of cars which are currently available, operator assigns the car which is the closest to the pick up spot ai. Needless to say, if a car is already on a ride with a passenger, it won't be available for any rides until that passenger is dropped off at the corresponding destination. \n  * If there are several such cars, operator will pick one of them which has been waiting the most since it became available. \n  * If there are several such cars, operator will pick one of them which has the lowest number. \n\n\n\nAfter a car gets assigned to the taxi ride request: \n\n  * The driver immediately starts driving from current position to the house ai. \n  * Once the car reaches house ai, the passenger is immediately picked up and the driver starts driving to house bi. \n  * Once house bi is reached, the passenger gets dropped off and the car becomes available for new rides staying next to the house bi. \n  * It is allowed for multiple cars to be located next to the same house at the same point in time, while waiting for ride requests or just passing by. \n\n\n\nIf there are no available cars at time ti when a request for taxi ride comes, then: \n\n  * The i-th passenger will have to wait for a car to become available. \n  * When a car becomes available, operator will immediately assign it to this taxi ride request. \n  * If multiple cars become available at once while the passenger is waiting, operator will pick a car out of them according to the rules described above. \n\n\n\nOperator processes taxi ride requests one by one. So if multiple passengers are waiting for the cars to become available, operator will not move on to processing the (i + 1)-th ride request until the car gets assigned to the i-th ride request.\n\nYour task is to write a program that will process the given list of m taxi ride requests. For each request you have to find out which car will get assigned to it, and how long the passenger will have to wait for a car to arrive.

Therefore wait time will be 1 and the ride will be completed at time 5 + 1 + 6 = 12. The second request comes in at time 9, so the passenger will have to wait for the car to become available at time 12, and then the car needs another 2 minutes to get from house 8 to house 10. So the total wait time is 3 + 2 = 5. \n\nIn the second sample test, cars 1 and 2 are located at the same distance from the first passenger and have the same \"wait time since it became available\".

        "instruction": "Berland.Taxi is a new taxi company with k cars which started operating in the capital of Berland just recently. The capital has n houses on a straight line numbered from 1 (leftmost) to n (rightmost), and the distance between any two neighboring houses is the same.\n\nYou have to help the company schedule all the taxi rides which come throughout the day according to the following rules: \n\n  * All cars are available for picking up passengers. Initially the j-th car is located next to the house with the number xj at time 0. \n  * All cars have the same speed. It takes exactly 1 minute for any car to travel between neighboring houses i and i + 1. \n  * The i-th request for taxi ride comes at the time ti, asking for a passenger to be picked up at the house ai and dropped off at the house bi. All requests for taxi rides are given in the increasing order of ti. All ti are distinct. \n\n\n\nWhen a request for taxi ride is received at time ti, Berland.Taxi operator assigns a car to it as follows: \n\n  * Out of cars which are currently available, operator assigns the car which is the closest to the pick up spot ai. Needless to say, if a car is already on a ride with a passenger, it won't be available for any rides until that passenger is dropped off at the corresponding destination. \n  * If there are several such cars, operator will pick one of them which has been waiting the most since it became available. \n  * If there are several such cars, operator will pick one of them which has the lowest number. \n\n\n\nAfter a car gets assigned to the taxi ride request: \n\n  * The driver immediately starts driving from current position to the house ai. \n  * Once the car reaches house ai, the passenger is immediately picked up and the driver starts driving to house bi. \n  * Once house bi is reached, the passenger gets dropped off and the car becomes available for new rides staying next to the house bi. \n  * It is allowed for multiple cars to be located next to the same house at the same point in time, while waiting for ride requests or just passing by. \n\n\n\nIf there are no available cars at time ti when a request for taxi ride comes, then: \n\n  * The i-th passenger will have to wait for a car to become available. \n  * When a car becomes available, operator will immediately assign it to this taxi ride request. \n  * If multiple cars become available at once while the passenger is waiting, operator will pick a car out of them according to the rules described above. \n\n\n\nOperator processes taxi ride requests one by one. So if multiple passengers are waiting for the cars to become available, operator will not move on to processing the (i + 1)-th ride request until the car gets assigned to the i-th ride request.\n\nYour task is to write a program that will process the given list of m taxi ride requests. For each request you have to find out which car will get assigned to it, and how long the passenger will have to wait for a car to arrive. Note, if there is already car located at the house ai, then the corresponding wait time will be 0.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains integers n, k and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b7105, 1 \u2264 k, m \u2264 2\u00b7105) \u2014 number of houses, number of cars, and number of taxi ride requests. The second line contains integers x1, x2, ..., xk (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 n) \u2014 initial positions of cars. xi is a house number at which the i-th car is located initially. It's allowed for more than one car to be located next to the same house.\n\nThe following m lines contain information about ride requests. Each ride request is represented by integers tj, aj and bj (1 \u2264 tj \u2264 1012, 1 \u2264 aj, bj \u2264 n, aj \u2260 bj), where tj is time in minutes when a request is made, aj is a house where passenger needs to be picked up, and bj is a house where passenger needs to be dropped off. All taxi ride requests are given in the increasing order of tj. All tj are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint m lines: the j-th line should contain two integer numbers, the answer for the j-th ride request \u2014 car number assigned by the operator and passenger wait time.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n10 1 2\n3\n5 2 8\n9 10 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 1\n1 5\n\n\nInput\n\n5 2 1\n1 5\n10 3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 2\n\n\nInput\n\n5 2 2\n1 5\n10 3 5\n20 4 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 2\n2 1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample test, a request comes in at time 5 and the car needs to get from house 3 to house 2 to pick up the passenger. Therefore wait time will be 1 and the ride will be completed at time 5 + 1 + 6 = 12. The second request comes in at time 9, so the passenger will have to wait for the car to become available at time 12, and then the car needs another 2 minutes to get from house 8 to house 10. So the total wait time is 3 + 2 = 5. \n\nIn the second sample test, cars 1 and 2 are located at the same distance from the first passenger and have the same \"wait time since it became available\". Car 1 wins a tiebreaker according to the rules because it has the lowest number. It will come to house 3 at time 3, so the wait time will be 2.",

Each element in the queue contains the time when the request was made, the pickup location, and the drop-off location.\n4. Process each ride request one by one. For each request, calculate the time when the car will become available and update the map M and the priority queue Q accordingly.\n5. If there are no available cars at the time the request is made, add the request to the priority queue Q and wait for a car to become available.\n6.

        "instruction": "Berland.Taxi is a new taxi company with k cars which started operating in the capital of Berland just recently. The capital has n houses on a straight line numbered from 1 (leftmost) to n (rightmost), and the distance between any two neighboring houses is the same.\n\nYou have to help the company schedule all the taxi rides which come throughout the day according to the following rules: \n\n  * All cars are available for picking up passengers. Initially the j-th car is located next to the house with the number xj at time 0. \n  * All cars have the same speed. It takes exactly 1 minute for any car to travel between neighboring houses i and i + 1. \n  * The i-th request for taxi ride comes at the time ti, asking for a passenger to be picked up at the house ai and dropped off at the house bi. All requests for taxi rides are given in the increasing order of ti. All ti are distinct. \n\n\n\nWhen a request for taxi ride is received at time ti, Berland.Taxi operator assigns a car to it as follows: \n\n  * Out of cars which are currently available, operator assigns the car which is the closest to the pick up spot ai. Needless to say, if a car is already on a ride with a passenger, it won't be available for any rides until that passenger is dropped off at the corresponding destination. \n  * If there are several such cars, operator will pick one of them which has been waiting the most since it became available. \n  * If there are several such cars, operator will pick one of them which has the lowest number. \n\n\n\nAfter a car gets assigned to the taxi ride request: \n\n  * The driver immediately starts driving from current position to the house ai. \n  * Once the car reaches house ai, the passenger is immediately picked up and the driver starts driving to house bi. \n  * Once house bi is reached, the passenger gets dropped off and the car becomes available for new rides staying next to the house bi. \n  * It is allowed for multiple cars to be located next to the same house at the same point in time, while waiting for ride requests or just passing by. \n\n\n\nIf there are no available cars at time ti when a request for taxi ride comes, then: \n\n  * The i-th passenger will have to wait for a car to become available. \n  * When a car becomes available, operator will immediately assign it to this taxi ride request. \n  * If multiple cars become available at once while the passenger is waiting, operator will pick a car out of them according to the rules described above. \n\n\n\nOperator processes taxi ride requests one by one. So if multiple passengers are waiting for the cars to become available, operator will not move on to processing the (i + 1)-th ride request until the car gets assigned to the i-th ride request.\n\nYour task is to write a program that will process the given list of m taxi ride requests. For each request you have to find out which car will get assigned to it, and how long the passenger will have to wait for a car to arrive. Note, if there is already car located at the house ai, then the corresponding wait time will be 0.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains integers n, k and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b7105, 1 \u2264 k, m \u2264 2\u00b7105) \u2014 number of houses, number of cars, and number of taxi ride requests. The second line contains integers x1, x2, ..., xk (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 n) \u2014 initial positions of cars. xi is a house number at which the i-th car is located initially. It's allowed for more than one car to be located next to the same house.\n\nThe following m lines contain information about ride requests. Each ride request is represented by integers tj, aj and bj (1 \u2264 tj \u2264 1012, 1 \u2264 aj, bj \u2264 n, aj \u2260 bj), where tj is time in minutes when a request is made, aj is a house where passenger needs to be picked up, and bj is a house where passenger needs to be dropped off. All taxi ride requests are given in the increasing order of tj. All tj are distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint m lines: the j-th line should contain two integer numbers, the answer for the j-th ride request \u2014 car number assigned by the operator and passenger wait time.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n10 1 2\n3\n5 2 8\n9 10 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 1\n1 5\n\n\nInput\n\n5 2 1\n1 5\n10 3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 2\n\n\nInput\n\n5 2 2\n1 5\n10 3 5\n20 4 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 2\n2 1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample test, a request comes in at time 5 and the car needs to get from house 3 to house 2 to pick up the passenger. Therefore wait time will be 1 and the ride will be completed at time 5 + 1 + 6 = 12. The second request comes in at time 9, so the passenger will have to wait for the car to become available at time 12, and then the car needs another 2 minutes to get from house 8 to house 10. So the total wait time is 3 + 2 = 5. \n\nIn the second sample test, cars 1 and 2 are located at the same distance from the first passenger and have the same \"wait time since it became available\". Car 1 wins a tiebreaker according to the rules because it has the lowest number. It will come to house 3 at time 3, so the wait time will be 2.",

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input string character by character and store it in a character array.\n2. Initialize a Trie data structure with a root node. Each node in the Trie will have a boolean flag to indicate whether it's a terminal node (i.e., the end of a word), an integer to store the count of words passing through the node, and an array of 26 pointers to store the next nodes for each alphabet letter.\n3. Iterate through the input string. If the current character is not a letter, increment the answer by 1 (since we need to type the non-letter character) and move to the next character.\n4. If the current character is a letter, find the next word in the input string by iterating through the letters until a non-letter character is encountered.\n5. For each word, check if the current prefix of the word is present in the Trie. If it is, calculate the minimum number of clicks required to type the word by considering two cases:\n   - If the current node in the Trie is a terminal node, increment the answer by 1 (since we can type the word by following the Trie's suggestion).\n   - If the current node in the Trie is not a terminal node, calculate the minimum number of clicks required to type the remaining part of the word by recursively calling the function for the next node in the Trie.\n6. If the current prefix of the word is not present in the Trie, increment the answer by the length of the word (since we need to type the entire word).\n7. Add the current word to the Trie by updating the count and next node pointers.\n8. Repeat steps 3-7 until the end of the input string is reached.\n9.

        "instruction": "Alice has a computer that operates on w-bit integers. The computer has n registers for values. The current content of the registers is given as an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n. \n\nThe computer uses so-called \"number gates\" to manipulate this data. Each \"number gate\" takes two registers as inputs and calculates a function of the two values stored in those registers. Note that you can use the same register as both inputs.\n\nEach \"number gate\" is assembled from bit gates. There are six types of bit gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT AND, NOT OR, and NOT XOR, denoted \"A\", \"O\", \"X\", \"a\", \"o\", \"x\", respectively. Each bit gate takes two bits as input. Its output given the input bits b_1, b_2 is given below:\n\n\\begin{matrix} b_1 & b_2 & A & O & X & a & o & x \\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\ \\end{matrix} \n\nTo build a \"number gate\", one takes w bit gates and assembles them into an array. A \"number gate\" takes two w-bit integers x_1 and x_2 as input. The \"number gate\" splits the integers into w bits and feeds the i-th bit of each input to the i-th bit gate. After that, it assembles the resulting bits again to form an output word. \n\nFor instance, for 4-bit computer we might have a \"number gate\" \"AXoA\" (AND, XOR, NOT OR, AND). For two inputs, 13 = 1101_2 and 10 = 1010_2, this returns 12 = 1100_2, as 1 and 1 is 1, 1 xor 0 is 1, not (0 or 1) is 0, and finally 1 and 0 is 0. \n\nYou are given a description of m \"number gates\". For each gate, your goal is to report the number of register pairs for which the \"number gate\" outputs the number 0. In other words, find the number of ordered pairs (i,j) where 1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 n, such that w_k(a_i, a_j) = 0, where w_k is the function computed by the k-th \"number gate\".\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers: w, n, and m~(1 \u2264 w \u2264 12, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u22c5 10^4, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 5\u22c5 10^4) \u2014 the word size, the number of variables, and the number of gates.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 a_i < 2^w) \u2014 the value of variables stored in the registers.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains a string g_j~(|g_j| = w) with a description of a single gate.

        "instruction": "Alice has a computer that operates on w-bit integers. The computer has n registers for values. The current content of the registers is given as an array a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n. \n\nThe computer uses so-called \"number gates\" to manipulate this data. Each \"number gate\" takes two registers as inputs and calculates a function of the two values stored in those registers. Note that you can use the same register as both inputs.\n\nEach \"number gate\" is assembled from bit gates. There are six types of bit gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT AND, NOT OR, and NOT XOR, denoted \"A\", \"O\", \"X\", \"a\", \"o\", \"x\", respectively. Each bit gate takes two bits as input. Its output given the input bits b_1, b_2 is given below:\n\n\\begin{matrix} b_1 & b_2 & A & O & X & a & o & x \\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\ \\end{matrix} \n\nTo build a \"number gate\", one takes w bit gates and assembles them into an array. A \"number gate\" takes two w-bit integers x_1 and x_2 as input. The \"number gate\" splits the integers into w bits and feeds the i-th bit of each input to the i-th bit gate. After that, it assembles the resulting bits again to form an output word. \n\nFor instance, for 4-bit computer we might have a \"number gate\" \"AXoA\" (AND, XOR, NOT OR, AND).
