Subtract the index i from each element A[i] to shift the array to the left, making it easier to find the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing.\n2. Initialize a priority queue PQ to store pairs of (minimum height, cost). The priority queue is used to keep track of the minimum height that can be reached with the current cost.\n3. Initialize the last element as A[0] and the cost as 1. The cost represents the number of operations required to reach the current last element.\n4. Iterate through the array A from index 1 to n-1. For each element A[i], check if it is equal to the last element. If it is, increment the cost by 1.\n5. If A[i] is greater than the last element, push the pair (last, cost) into the priority queue PQ and update the last element as A[i]. Reset the cost to 1.\n6. If A[i] is less than the last element, calculate the minimum number of operations required to reach A[i] from the last element.

He has n distinct pairs of socks which are initially in a bag. The pairs are numbered from 1 to n. Andryusha wants to put paired socks together and put them in the wardrobe. He takes the socks one by one from the bag, and for each sock he looks whether the pair of this sock has been already took out of the bag, or not. If not (that means the pair of this sock is still in the bag), he puts the current socks on the table in front of him. Otherwise, he puts both socks from the pair to the wardrobe.\n\nAndryusha remembers the order in which he took the socks from the bag.

Then he took the next sock which is from the first pair as well, so he immediately puts both socks to the wardrobe. Thus, at most one sock was on the table at the same time.\n\nIn the second example Andryusha behaved as follows: \n\n  * Initially the table was empty, he took out a sock from pair 2 and put it on the table. \n  * Sock (2) was on the table.

Andryusha took out a sock from pair 2, and put this pair into the wardrobe. \n  * Sock (3) was on the table.

The rules of poker on this website are a bit strange: there are always two players in a hand, there are no bets, and the winner takes 1 virtual bourle from the loser.\n\nLast evening Roma started to play poker. He decided to spend no more than k virtual bourles \u2014 he will stop immediately if the number of his loses exceeds the number of his wins by k. Also Roma will leave the game if he wins enough money for the evening, i.e. if the number of wins exceeds the number of loses by k.\n\nNext morning Roma found a piece of paper with a sequence on it representing his results. Roma doesn't remember the results exactly, and some characters in the sequence are written in a way such that it's impossible to recognize this character, so Roma can't recall whether he won k bourles or he lost.\n\nThe sequence written by Roma is a string s consisting of characters W (Roma won the corresponding hand), L (Roma lost), D (draw) and ?

Define a function val() to map characters W, L, and D to their corresponding integer values (1, -1, and 0, respectively).\n5. Define a function f() to perform the dynamic programming. It takes two parameters: p (the current position in the sequence) and d (the current difference between wins and losses).\n6. In the f() function, check the base cases:\n   - If p equals n, check if the absolute difference d equals k. If it does, return 1 (indicating a valid sequence); otherwise, return 0.\n   - If the absolute difference d equals k, return 0 (indicating an invalid sequence).\n7. If the current character in the sequence is not '?', recursively call f() with the next position p+1 and the updated difference d+val(S[p]).\n8. If the current character is '?', try all possible values (W, L, and D) and recursively call f() with the next position p+1 and the updated difference d+val(c), where c is the current character being tried.\n9.

Define a function `f` that checks if a given split point `mid` and `start` satisfies the conditions of the problem. The function uses the `get_hash` method of the `st_hash` object to calculate the hash values of the left, middle, and right parts of the string.\n4. In the `solve` function, iterate over all possible split points `start` and find the corresponding `mid` value that satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n5.

The vector v is a 26xN matrix, where N is the length of s1. The index of the vector v is the ASCII value of the character minus 'a', and the value at that index is a vector of indices in s1 where that character appears.\n3.

Iterate over each character in s2. For each character, find its index in v. If the vector v for that character is empty, it means s2 contains a character that does not appear in s1, so print -1 and exit.\n5.

        "instruction": "You are given a straight half-line divided into segments of unit length, which we will call positions. The positions are numbered by positive integers that start with 1 from the end of half-line, i. e. 1, 2, 3 and so on. The distance between the positions is the absolute difference between the respective numbers. \n\nLaharl, Etna and Flonne occupy some positions on the half-line and they want to get to the position with the largest possible number. They are originally placed in different positions. \n\nEach of the characters can perform each of the following actions no more than once: \n\n  * Move a certain distance. \n  * Grab another character and lift him above the head. \n  * Throw the lifted character a certain distance. \n\n\n\nEach character has a movement range parameter. They can only move to free positions, assuming that distance between those positions doesn't exceed the movement range. \n\nOne character can lift another character if the distance between the two characters equals 1, and no one already holds that another character. We can assume that the lifted character moves to the same position as the person who has lifted him, and the position in which he stood before becomes free. A lifted character cannot perform any actions and the character that holds him cannot walk. \n\nAlso, each character has a throwing range parameter. It is the distance at which this character can throw the one lifted above his head. He can only throw a character to a free position, and only when there is a lifted character. \n\nWe accept the situation when one person grabs another one who in his turn has the third character in his hands. This forms a \"column\" of three characters. For example, Laharl can hold Etna while Etna holds Flonne. In this case, Etna and the Flonne cannot perform any actions, and Laharl can only throw Etna (together with Flonne) at some distance. \n\nLaharl, Etna and Flonne perform actions in any order. They perform actions in turns, that is no two of them can do actions at the same time.\n\nDetermine the maximum number of position at least one of the characters can reach. That is, such maximal number x so that one of the characters can reach position x.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers: Laharl's position, his movement range and throwing range. The second and the third lines describe Etna's and Flonne's parameters correspondingly in the similar form. It is guaranteed that the three characters occupy distinct positions. All numbers in the input are between 1 and 10, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the maximum ordinal number of position which either Laharl, Etna or Flonne can reach.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n9 3 3\n4 3 1\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n15\n\nNote\n\nLet us explain how to reach position 15 in the sample.\n\nInitially Laharl occupies position 9, Etna \u2014 position 4 and Flonne \u2014 position 2.\n\nFirst Laharl moves to position 6.\n\nThen Flonne moves to position 5 and grabs Etna.\n\nLaharl grabs Flonne and throws to position 9.\n\nFlonne throws Etna to position 12.\n\nEtna moves to position 15.",

        "instruction": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nChouti was tired of studying, so he opened the computer and started playing a puzzle game.\n\nLong long ago, the boy found a sequence s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_n of length n, kept by a tricky interactor. It consisted of 0s and 1s only and the number of 1s is t. The boy knows nothing about this sequence except n and t, but he can try to find it out with some queries with the interactor.\n\nWe define an operation called flipping. Flipping [l,r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) means for each x \u2208 [l,r], changing s_x to 1-s_x.\n\nIn each query, the boy can give the interactor two integers l,r satisfying 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n and the interactor will either flip [1,r] or [l,n] (both outcomes have the same probability and all decisions made by interactor are independent from each other, see Notes section for more details). The interactor will tell the current number of 1s after each operation. Note, that the sequence won't be restored after each operation.\n\nHelp the boy to find the original sequence in no more than 10000 interactions.\n\n\"Weird legend, dumb game.\" he thought. However, after several tries, he is still stuck with it. Can you help him beat this game?\n\nInteraction\n\nThe interaction starts with a line containing two integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 n) \u2014 the length of the sequence and the number of 1s in it.\n\nAfter that, you can make queries.\n\nTo make a query, print a line \"? l r\" (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n), then flush the output.\n\nAfter each query, read a single integer t (-1 \u2264 t \u2264 n).\n\n  * If t=-1, it means that you're out of queries, you should terminate your program immediately, then you will get Wrong Answer, otherwise the judging result would be undefined because you will interact with a closed stream.\n  * If t \u2265 0, it represents the current number of 1s in the sequence.\n\n\n\nWhen you found the original sequence, print a line \"! s\", flush the output and terminate. Print s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_n as a binary string and do not print spaces in between.\n\nYour solution will get Idleness Limit Exceeded if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output.\n\nTo flush you need to do the following right after printing a query and a line end: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see documentation for other languages. \n\n\n\nHacks\n\nFor hacks, use the following format:\n\nIn the first and only line, print a non-empty binary string. Its length will be n and it will be treated as s_1, s_2, \u2026, s_n.\n\nFor example, the the test corresponding to the example contains a line \"0011\".\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n4 2\n2\n2\n0\n\nOutput\n\n? 1 1\n? 1 1\n? 3 4\n! 0011\n\nNote\n\nFor first query 1,1, the interactor should flip [1,1] or [1,4]. It chose to flip [1,4], so the sequence became 1100.\n\nFor second query 1,1, the interactor should flip [1,1] or [1,4]. It again chose to flip [1,4], so the sequence became 0011.\n\nFor third query 3,4, the interactor should flip [1,4] or [3,4]. It chose to flip [3,4], so the sequence became 0000.\n\nQ: How does interactor choose between [1,r] and [l,n]? Is it really random?\n\nA: The interactor will use a secret [pseudorandom number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator). Only s and your queries will be hashed and used as the seed. So if you give the same sequence of queries twice for the same secret string, you will get the same results. Except this, you can consider the choices fully random, like flipping a fair coin. You needn't (and shouldn't) exploit the exact generator to pass this problem.",

In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most 4 translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\nYou will work with a string S, which is initially empty. For m times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to S, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nSince the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 3 000) \u2014 the number of modifications to S. \n\nEach of the next m lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to S.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint m lines, the i-th of which being the answer after the i-th modification to S.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n3\n7\n\n\nInput\n\n5\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n4\n10\n22\n43\n\n\nInput\n\n9\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n3\n10\n24\n51\n109\n213\n421\n833\n\nNote\n\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to S, so S is \"111\".\n\nAs you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter.

Use Dijkstra's algorithm: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum time required to reach each settlement from the king's residence. The algorithm starts with the king's residence and explores the graph by considering all possible next settlements and the time it takes to reach them. The algorithm uses a priority queue to efficiently select the next settlement to explore.\n\n7.

For all integers i between 1 and k inclusive, s_i and t_i are anagrams of each other. \n\n\n\nIf such strings don't exist, then t is said to be an irreducible anagram of s. Note that these notions are only defined when s and t are anagrams of each other.\n\nFor example, consider the string s =  \"gamegame\". Then the string t =  \"megamage\" is a reducible anagram of s, we may choose for example s_1 =  \"game\", s_2 =  \"gam\", s_3 =  \"e\" and t_1 =  \"mega\", t_2 =  \"mag\", t_3 =  \"e\":\n\n<image>\n\nOn the other hand, we can prove that t =  \"memegaga\" is an irreducible anagram of s.\n\nYou will be given a string s and q queries, represented by two integers 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 |s| (where |s| is equal to the length of the string s). For each query, you should find if the substring of s formed by characters from the l-th to the r-th has at least one irreducible anagram.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a string s, consisting of lowercase English characters (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the following q lines contain two integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 |s|), representing a query for the substring of s formed by characters from the l-th to the r-th.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, print a single line containing \"Yes\" (without quotes) if the corresponding substring has at least one irreducible anagram, and a single line containing \"No\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\naaaaa\n3\n1 1\n2 4\n5 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nInput\n\n\naabbbbbbc\n6\n1 2\n2 4\n2 2\n1 9\n5 7\n3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample, in the first and third queries, the substring is \"a\", which has itself as an irreducible anagram since two or more non-empty strings cannot be put together to obtain \"a\". On the other hand, in the second query, the substring is \"aaa\", which has no irreducible anagrams: its only anagram is itself, and we may choose s_1 =  \"a\", s_2 =  \"aa\", t_1 =  \"a\", t_2 =  \"aa\" to show that it is a reducible anagram.\n\nIn the second query of the second sample, the substring is \"abb\", which has, for example, \"bba\" as an irreducible anagram.",
