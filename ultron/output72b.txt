            "constraint_handling": "The solution effectively handles the constraint of large ranges (up to 10^18) by generating peaks on-the-fly rather than precomputing them. This approach ensures that the solution remains efficient and does not consume excessive memory.",
            "important_ideas": "The solution incorporates key ideas from the problem understanding, such as the specific structure of peaks (first half increasing, second half decreasing) and the need to check for multiples of M. It constructs peaks iteratively or recursively, ensuring that only valid peaks are considered.",
            "edge_case_handling": "The solution handles edge cases well, such as single-digit numbers being considered peaks and ranges where no peaks exist. It can efficiently generate and check peaks for any given range, including those with a single number.",

Given the constraints, this complexity is reasonable and should perform well within the required time limit.",
            "space_efficiency": "The space complexity is O(1) for the dynamic generation approach, as it does not require storing all peaks in memory. Only the current peak being generated and the final count of valid peaks are stored, making it highly memory-efficient."

            "simplicity_vs_efficiency": "While the dynamic generation approach is more complex than precomputing all peaks, it offers a better balance between simplicity and efficiency. It avoids the memory overhead of precomputing and storing large numbers of peaks, making it more scalable for very large ranges. The core logic for generating peaks is straightforward and can be implemented using recursion or iteration, maintaining a good level of simplicity."

        "improvements": "Future improvements could include optimizing the peak generation algorithm to reduce the number of unnecessary checks, such as early termination when a partial peak exceeds the upper bound B.
