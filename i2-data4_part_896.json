For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.\n\nPetya loves tickets very much. As we know, each ticket has a number that is a positive integer. Its length equals n (n is always even). Petya calls a ticket lucky if the ticket's number is a lucky number and the sum of digits in the first half (the sum of the first n / 2 digits) equals the sum of digits in the second half (the sum of the last n / 2 digits). Check if the given ticket is lucky.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an even integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the ticket number that needs to be checked. The second line contains an integer whose length equals exactly n \u2014 the ticket number. The number may contain leading zeros.\n\nOutput\n\nOn the first line print \"YES\" if the given ticket number is lucky. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2\n47\n\n\nOutput\n\nNO\n\n\nInput\n\n4\n4738\n\n\nOutput\n\nNO\n\n\nInput\n\n4\n4774\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample the sum of digits in the first half does not equal the sum of digits in the second half (4 \u2260 7).\n\nIn the second sample the ticket number is not the lucky number.",

Formally, let b_i be the height of Wowo's aircraft at checkpoint i, x_i^-\u2264 b_i\u2264 x_i^+ should be satisfied for all integers i between 1 and n, where x_i^- and x_i^+ are given integers.\n\nThe angle of Wowo's aircraft is also limited. For example, it cannot make a 90-degree climb. Formally, y_i^-\u2264 b_i-b_{i-1}\u2264 y_i^+ should be satisfied for all integers i between 2 and n, where y_i^- and y_i^+ are given integers.\n\nThe final limitation is the speed of angling up or angling down. An aircraft should change its angle slowly for safety concerns. Formally, z_i^- \u2264 (b_i - b_{i-1}) - (b_{i-1} - b_{i-2}) \u2264 z_i^+ should be satisfied for all integers i between 3 and n, where z_i^- and z_i^+ are given integers.\n\nTaking all these into consideration, Wowo finds that the heights at checkpoints are too hard for him to choose.

        "instruction": "After hearing the story of Dr. Zhang, Wowo decides to plan his own flight around the world. \n\nHe already chose n checkpoints in the world map. Due to the landform and the clouds, he cannot fly too high or too low. Formally, let b_i be the height of Wowo's aircraft at checkpoint i, x_i^-\u2264 b_i\u2264 x_i^+ should be satisfied for all integers i between 1 and n, where x_i^- and x_i^+ are given integers.\n\nThe angle of Wowo's aircraft is also limited. For example, it cannot make a 90-degree climb. Formally, y_i^-\u2264 b_i-b_{i-1}\u2264 y_i^+ should be satisfied for all integers i between 2 and n, where y_i^- and y_i^+ are given integers.\n\nThe final limitation is the speed of angling up or angling down. An aircraft should change its angle slowly for safety concerns. Formally, z_i^- \u2264 (b_i - b_{i-1}) - (b_{i-1} - b_{i-2}) \u2264 z_i^+ should be satisfied for all integers i between 3 and n, where z_i^- and z_i^+ are given integers.\n\nTaking all these into consideration, Wowo finds that the heights at checkpoints are too hard for him to choose. Please help Wowo decide whether there exists a sequence of real numbers b_1, \u2026, b_n satisfying all the contraints above.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 66 666). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000).\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_i^-, x_i^+ (-10^8\u2264 x_i^-\u2264 x_i^+\u2264 10^8) denoting the lower and upper bound of b_i. \n\nThe i-th of the next n-1 lines contains two integers y_{i+1}^-, y_{i+1}^+ (-10^8\u2264 y_{i+1}^-\u2264 y_{i+1}^+\u2264 10^8) denoting the lower and upper bound of b_{i+1}-b_i. \n\nThe i-th of the next n-2 lines contains two integers z_{i+2}^-, z_{i+2}^+ (-10^8\u2264 z_{i+2}^-\u2264 z_{i+2}^+\u2264 10^8) denoting the lower and upper bound of (b_{i+2}-b_{i+1}) - (b_{i+1}-b_i). \n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200 000.\n\nIt is guaranteed that relaxing every constraint by 10^{-6} (i.e., decrease x_i^-, y_i^-, z_i^- by 10^{-6} and increase x_i^+, y_i^+, z_i^+ by 10^{-6}) will not change the answer. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output YES if a sequence b_1,\u2026, b_n satisfying the constraints exists and NO otherwise. The sequence b_1,\u2026, b_n is not required.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3\n0 1\n0 1\n0 1\n1 1\n1 1\n-100 100\n3\n-967 541\n-500 834\n-724 669\n-858 978\n-964 962\n-645 705\n4\n0 0\n0 1\n0 1\n1 1\n0 1\n0 1\n0 1\n0 0\n0 0\n4\n0 0\n33 34\n65 66\n100 100\n0 100\n0 100\n0 100\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, all b_i's are in [0,1]. Because of the constraints 1=y_2^-\u2264 b_2-b_1\u2264 y_2^+=1, b_2-b_1 must be 1. So b_2=1 and b_1=0 must hold. Then by 1=y_3^-\u2264 b_3-b_2\u2264 y_3^+=1, b_3 equals 2. This contradicts the constraint of b_3\u2264 1. So no solution exists.\n\nIn the second test case, we can let all b_i's be 0.\n\nIn the third test case, one possible solution is b_1=0, b_2=1/3, b_3=2/3, b_4=1. ",

Iterate through the constraints for b_3 to b_n, updating the hulls at each step by cutting, transforming, and translating the points as necessary.\n5.

Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.\n\nNikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.\n\nNikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).\n\nDetermine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game.

Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.\n\nNikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.\n\nNikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).\n\nDetermine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game.

So every next number is the sum of the previous two.\n\nBajtek has developed a nice way to compute Fibonacci numbers on a blackboard. First, he writes a 0. Then, below it, he writes a 1. Then he performs the following two operations:\n\n  * operation \"T\": replace the top number with the sum of both numbers; \n  * operation \"B\": replace the bottom number with the sum of both numbers. \n\n\n\nIf he performs n operations, starting with \"T\" and then choosing operations alternately (so that the sequence of operations looks like \"TBTBTBTB...\"), the last number written will be equal to fn + 1.\n\nUnfortunately, Bajtek sometimes makes mistakes and repeats an operation two or more times in a row. For example, if Bajtek wanted to compute f7, then he would want to do n = 6 operations: \"TBTBTB\". If he instead performs the sequence of operations \"TTTBBT\", then he will have made 3 mistakes, and he will incorrectly compute that the seventh Fibonacci number is 10. The number of mistakes in the sequence of operations is the number of neighbouring equal operations (\u00abTT\u00bb or \u00abBB\u00bb).\n\nYou are given the number n of operations that Bajtek has made in an attempt to compute fn + 1 and the number r that is the result of his computations (that is last written number). Find the minimum possible number of mistakes that Bajtek must have made and any possible sequence of n operations resulting in r with that number of mistakes.\n\nAssume that Bajtek always correctly starts with operation \"T\".\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains the integers n and r (1 \u2264 n, r \u2264 106).\n\nOutput\n\nThe first line of the output should contain one number \u2014 the minimum possible number of mistakes made by Bajtek. The second line should contain n characters, starting with \"T\", describing one possible sequence of operations with that number of mistakes. Each character must be either \"T\" or \"B\".\n\nIf the required sequence doesn't exist, output \"IMPOSSIBLE\" (without quotes).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n6 10\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\nTBBTTB\n\n\nInput\n\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\nTBTB\n\n\nInput\n\n2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\nIMPOSSIBLE",

Knowing that Iahub needs 1 second to travel from one cell to another, find the minimum time in which he can arrive in cell (n, n).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 109) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 105). Each of the next m lines contains a pair of integers, x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n), representing the coordinates of the volcanoes.\n\nConsider matrix rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and matrix columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. There is no volcano in cell (1, 1). No two volcanoes occupy the same location. \n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer, the minimum time in which Iahub can arrive at cell (n, n). If no solution exists (there is no path to the final cell), print -1.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4 2\n1 3\n1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n6\n\n\nInput\n\n7 8\n1 6\n2 6\n3 5\n3 6\n4 3\n5 1\n5 2\n5 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n2 2\n1 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n-1\n\nNote\n\nConsider the first sample.

The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.\n\nValera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:\n\n  * on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; \n  * all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. \n\n\n\nHelp Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 \u2264 n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters \u2014 the description of Valera's paper.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\".

        "instruction": "Many students live in a dormitory. A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks. \n\nThere is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning. That's why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door. As soon as the shower opens, the first person from the line enters the shower. After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower. The process continues until everybody in the line has a shower.\n\nHaving a shower takes some time, so the students in the line talk as they wait. At each moment of time the students talk in pairs: the (2i - 1)-th man in the line (for the current moment) talks with the (2i)-th one. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Let's number the people from 1 to 5. Let's assume that the line initially looks as 23154 (person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line). Then, before the shower opens, 2 talks with 3, 1 talks with 5, 4 doesn't talk with anyone. Then 2 enters the shower. While 2 has a shower, 3 and 1 talk, 5 and 4 talk too. Then, 3 enters the shower. While 3 has a shower, 1 and 5 talk, 4 doesn't talk to anyone. Then 1 enters the shower and while he is there, 5 and 4 talk. Then 5 enters the shower, and then 4 enters the shower.\n\nWe know that if students i and j talk, then the i-th student's happiness increases by gij and the j-th student's happiness increases by gji. Your task is to find such initial order of students in the line that the total happiness of all students will be maximum in the end. Please note that some pair of students may have a talk several times. In the example above students 1 and 5 talk while they wait for the shower to open and while 3 has a shower.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of five lines, each line contains five space-separated integers: the j-th number in the i-th line shows gij (0 \u2264 gij \u2264 105). It is guaranteed that gii = 0 for all i.\n\nAssume that the students are numbered from 1 to 5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total happiness of the students.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n32\n\n\nInput\n\n0 43 21 18 2\n3 0 21 11 65\n5 2 0 1 4\n54 62 12 0 99\n87 64 81 33 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n620\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample, the optimal arrangement of the line is 23154. In this case, the total happiness equals:\n\n(g23 + g32 + g15 + g51) + (g13 + g31 + g54 + g45) + (g15 + g51) + (g54 + g45) = 32.",

If the recursive call returns 0, it means that the opposite player cannot win from the updated state, so we return 1.\n7. After exploring all possible moves, if no winning move is found, return 0.\n8. In the `Solve` function, read the input data and convert it into a binary string as described in step 2.\n9. Initialize the state `s` with the binary string.\n10. Call the `SG` function with the initial state `s` and the first player (0) to determine who will get the cake.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n#pragma GCC optimize(\"Ofast,no-stack-protector,unroll-loops,fast-math\")\n#pragma GCC target( \\\n    \"sse,sse2,sse3,ssse3,sse4.1,sse4.2,avx,avx2,popcnt,tune=native\")\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Define constants\nconst int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;\nconst long long LINF = 0x3f3f3f3f3f3f3f3fLL;\nconst double PI = acos(-1.0);\nconst double EPS = 1e-8;\nconst int MOD = 1e9 + 7;\n\n// Function to compute x^n modulo MOD\nlong long qpow(long long x, long long n) {\n  long long res = 1;\n  while (n) {\n    if (n & 1) res = res * x % MOD;\n    x = x * x % MOD;\n    n >>= 1;\n  }\n  return res;\n}\n\n// Define namespace Solver\nnamespace Solver {\n  // Initialize once\n  void InitOnce() {}\n\n  // Define cell IDs\n  int id[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18};\n\n  // Define left, right, and middle neighbor indices\n  int goL[] = {3,  4,  5,  7,  8,  9,  10, -1, 12, 13,\n               14, 15, -1, 16, 17, 18, -1, -1, -1};\n  int goR[] = {1,  2,  -1, 4,  5,  6,  -1, 8,  9, 10,\n               11, -1, 13, 14, 15, -1, 17, 18, -1};\n  int goM[] = {4,  5,  6,  8,  9,  10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n               15, -1, 16, 17, 18, -1, -1, -1, -1};\n\n  // Define memoization table\n  int sg[1 << 21];\n\n  // Function to compute SG(s, cur)\n  int SG(int s, int cur) {\n    // Compute position in memoization table\n    int pos = (s << 1) | cur;\n\n    // If result is already computed, return it\n    if (sg[pos]!= -1) return sg[pos];\n\n    // Iterate over all cells\n    for (int i = 0; i < 19; ++i) {\n      // If cell contains a chocolate\n      if (s >> i & 1) {\n        // Initialize eat variable\n        int tt = i, eat = 0;\n\n        // Perform DFS to explore all possible moves\n        do {\n          eat |= (1 << tt);\n          // If opposite player cannot win, return 1\n          if (SG(s ^ eat, 1 - cur) == 0) return sg[pos] = 1;\n          tt = goL[tt];\n          if (tt == -1) break;\n        } while (s >> tt & 1);\n\n        tt = i, eat = 0;\n        do {\n          eat |= (1 << tt);\n          // If opposite player cannot win, return 1\n          if (SG(s ^ eat, 1 - cur) == 0) return sg[pos] = 1;\n          tt = goR[tt];\n          if (tt == -1) break;\n        } while (s >> tt & 1);\n\n        tt = i, eat = 0;\n        do {\n          eat |= (1 << tt);\n          // If opposite player cannot win, return 1\n          if (SG(s ^ eat, 1 - cur) == 0) return sg[pos] = 1;\n          tt = goM[tt];\n          if (tt == -1) break;\n        } while (s >> tt & 1);\n      }\n    }\n\n    // If no winning move is found, return 0\n    return sg[pos] = 0;\n  }\n\n  // Function to read input\n  void Read() {}\n\n  // Function to solve the problem\n  void Solve() {\n    // Read input data\n    stack<int> stk;\n    char c;\n    while (cin >> c) {\n      // Convert 'O' to 1 and '.' to 0\n      if (c == 'O')\n        stk.push(1);\n      else\n        stk.push(0);\n    }\n\n    // Convert stack to binary string\n    int s = 0;\n    while (!stk.empty()) {\n      s = s << 1;\n      s |= stk.top();\n      stk.pop();\n    }\n\n    // Initialize memoization table\n    memset(sg, -1, sizeof(sg));\n\n    // Determine who will get the cake\n    if (SG(s, 0))\n      puts(\"Karlsson\");\n    else\n      puts(\"Lillebror\");\n\n    // Exit program\n    exit(0);\n  }\n}  // namespace Solver\n\n// Main function\nint main() {\n  // Initialize once\n  Solver::InitOnce();\n\n  // Read input and solve the problem\n  while (true) {\n    Solver::Read();\n    Solver::Solve();\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```",
