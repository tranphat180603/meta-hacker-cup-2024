ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon recognizes only m different colors, so 0 \u2264 ci \u2264 m, where ci = 0 means that tree i is uncolored.\n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon decides to color only the uncolored trees, i.e. the trees with ci = 0. They can color each of them them in any of the m colors from 1 to m. Coloring the i-th tree with color j requires exactly pi, j litres of paint.\n\nThe two friends define the beauty of a coloring of the trees as the minimum number of contiguous groups (each group contains some subsegment of trees) you can split all the n trees into so that each group contains trees of the same color. For example, if the colors of the trees from left to right are 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, the beauty of the coloring is 7, since we can partition the trees into 7 contiguous groups of the same color : {2}, {1, 1, 1}, {3}, {2, 2}, {3}, {1}, {3}. \n\nZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon wants to color all uncolored trees so that the beauty of the coloring is exactly k. They need your help to determine the minimum amount of paint (in litres) needed to finish the job.\n\nPlease note that the friends can't color the trees that are already colored.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers, n, m and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of trees, number of colors and beauty of the resulting coloring respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers c1, c2, ..., cn (0 \u2264 ci \u2264 m), the initial colors of the trees. ci equals to 0 if the tree number i is uncolored, otherwise the i-th tree has color ci.\n\nThen n lines follow. Each of them contains m integers. The j-th number on the i-th of them line denotes pi, j (1 \u2264 pi, j \u2264 109) \u2014 the amount of litres the friends need to color i-th tree with color j. pi, j's are specified even for the initially colored trees, but such trees still can't be colored.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer, the minimum amount of paint needed to color the trees. If there are no valid tree colorings of beauty k, print  - 1.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3 2 2\n0 0 0\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n10\n\nInput\n\n3 2 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n-1\n\nInput\n\n3 2 2\n2 0 0\n1 3\n2 4\n3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n5\n\nInput\n\n3 2 3\n2 1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample case, coloring the trees with colors 2, 1, 1 minimizes the amount of paint used, which equals to 2 + 3 + 5 = 10. Note that 1, 1, 1 would not be valid because the beauty of such coloring equals to 1 ({1, 1, 1} is a way to group the trees into a single group of the same color).\n\nIn the second sample case, all the trees are colored, but the beauty of the coloring is 3, so there is no valid coloring, and the answer is  - 1.\n\nIn the last sample case, all the trees are colored and the beauty of the coloring matches k, so no paint is used and the answer is 0.

        "instruction": "The first semester ended. You know, after the end of the first semester the holidays begin. On holidays Noora decided to return to Vi\u010dkopolis. As a modest souvenir for Leha, she brought a sausage of length m from Pavlopolis. Everyone knows that any sausage can be represented as a string of lowercase English letters, the length of which is equal to the length of the sausage.\n\nLeha was very pleased with the gift and immediately ate the sausage. But then he realized that it was a quite tactless act, because the sausage was a souvenir! So the hacker immediately went to the butcher shop. Unfortunately, there was only another sausage of length n in the shop. However Leha was not upset and bought this sausage. After coming home, he decided to cut the purchased sausage into several pieces and number the pieces starting from 1 from left to right. Then he wants to select several pieces and glue them together so that the obtained sausage is equal to the sausage that Noora gave. But the hacker can glue two pieces together only when the number of the left piece is less than the number of the right piece. Besides he knows that if he glues more than x pieces, Noora will notice that he has falsified souvenir sausage and will be very upset. Of course Leha doesn\u2019t want to upset the girl. The hacker asks you to find out whether he is able to cut the sausage he bought, and then glue some of the pieces so that Noora doesn't notice anything.\n\nFormally, you are given two strings s and t. The length of the string s is n, the length of the string t is m. It is required to select several pairwise non-intersecting substrings from s, so that their concatenation in the same order as these substrings appear in s, is equal to the string t. Denote by f(s, t) the minimal number of substrings to be chosen so that their concatenation is equal to the string t. If it is impossible to choose such substrings, then f(s, t) = \u221e.

Then he numbers received parts from 1 to 6:\n\n  * h \u2014 number 1\n  * loy \u2014 number 2\n  * a \u2014 number 3\n  * y \u2014 number 4\n  * g \u2014 number 5\n  * rt \u2014 number 6\n\n\n\nHereupon the hacker should glue the parts with numbers 2, 4 and 6 and get sausage loyygrt equal to one that is given by Noora. Thus, he will have to glue three pieces. Since x = 3 you should print \"YES\" (without quotes).\n\nIn the second sample both sausages coincide with sausages from the first sample. However since x = 2 you should print \"NO\" (without quotes).",

        "instruction": "The first semester ended. You know, after the end of the first semester the holidays begin. On holidays Noora decided to return to Vi\u010dkopolis. As a modest souvenir for Leha, she brought a sausage of length m from Pavlopolis. Everyone knows that any sausage can be represented as a string of lowercase English letters, the length of which is equal to the length of the sausage.\n\nLeha was very pleased with the gift and immediately ate the sausage. But then he realized that it was a quite tactless act, because the sausage was a souvenir! So the hacker immediately went to the butcher shop. Unfortunately, there was only another sausage of length n in the shop. However Leha was not upset and bought this sausage. After coming home, he decided to cut the purchased sausage into several pieces and number the pieces starting from 1 from left to right. Then he wants to select several pieces and glue them together so that the obtained sausage is equal to the sausage that Noora gave. But the hacker can glue two pieces together only when the number of the left piece is less than the number of the right piece. Besides he knows that if he glues more than x pieces, Noora will notice that he has falsified souvenir sausage and will be very upset. Of course Leha doesn\u2019t want to upset the girl. The hacker asks you to find out whether he is able to cut the sausage he bought, and then glue some of the pieces so that Noora doesn't notice anything.\n\nFormally, you are given two strings s and t. The length of the string s is n, the length of the string t is m. It is required to select several pairwise non-intersecting substrings from s, so that their concatenation in the same order as these substrings appear in s, is equal to the string t. Denote by f(s, t) the minimal number of substrings to be chosen so that their concatenation is equal to the string t. If it is impossible to choose such substrings, then f(s, t) = \u221e. Leha really wants to know whether it\u2019s true that f(s, t) \u2264 x.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 length of sausage bought by Leha, i.e. the length of the string s.\n\nThe second line contains string s of the length n consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line contains single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n) \u2014 length of sausage bought by Noora, i.e. the length of the string t.\n\nThe fourth line contains string t of the length m consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe fifth line contains single integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 30) \u2014 the maximum number of pieces of sausage that Leha can glue so that Noora doesn\u2019t notice anything.\n\nOutput\n\nIn the only line print \"YES\" (without quotes), if Leha is able to succeed in creating new sausage so that Noora doesn't notice anything. Otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n9\nhloyaygrt\n6\nloyyrt\n3\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES\n\n\nInput\n\n9\nhloyaygrt\n6\nloyyrt\n2\n\n\nOutput\n\nNO\n\nNote\n\nLet's consider the first sample.\n\nIn the optimal answer, Leha should cut the sausage he bought in the following way: hloyaygrt = h + loy + a + y + g + rt. Then he numbers received parts from 1 to 6:\n\n  * h \u2014 number 1\n  * loy \u2014 number 2\n  * a \u2014 number 3\n  * y \u2014 number 4\n  * g \u2014 number 5\n  * rt \u2014 number 6\n\n\n\nHereupon the hacker should glue the parts with numbers 2, 4 and 6 and get sausage loyygrt equal to one that is given by Noora. Thus, he will have to glue three pieces. Since x = 3 you should print \"YES\" (without quotes).\n\nIn the second sample both sausages coincide with sausages from the first sample. However since x = 2 you should print \"NO\" (without quotes).",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input values for the lengths of the two sausages, n and m, and the maximum number of pieces Leha can glue, x.\n2. Read the strings A and B representing the two sausages.\n3. Precompute the power values for the hash function and their modular inverses.\n4. Create the hash values for the strings A and B using the precomputed power values and their modular inverses.\n5. Initialize a 2D dynamic programming table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (x+1) and set dp[0][0] to 0.\n6. Iterate through the strings A and B, and for each position i in A and j in the current dp table, find the longest common prefix (lcp) between the substrings of A and B ending at i and j.\n7. Update the dp table by considering two cases: either the current lcp is not part of the current substring of A, or it is.\n8. If the final value in the dp table is equal to m, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\".\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Precompute power values for the hash function\nvector<long long> power(1000010);\nvector<long long> powerx(100010);\n\n// Precompute modular inverses of power values\nvector<long long> inv(100010);\nvector<long long> invx(100010);\n\n// Function to compute modular exponentiation\nlong long modexp(long long a, long long b) {\n  // Compute a^b mod 1000000007\n  long long ans = 1;\n  while (b) {\n    if (b & 1) ans = (ans * a) % 1000000007;\n    a = (a * a) % 1000000007;\n    b /= 2;\n  }\n  return ans;\n}\n\n// Function to compute modular exponentiation with a different modulus\nlong long modexpx(long long a, long long b) {\n  // Compute a^b mod 15487019\n  long long ans = 1;\n  while (b) {\n    if (b & 1) ans = (ans * a) % 15487019;\n    a = (a * a) % 15487019;\n    b /= 2;\n  }\n  return ans;\n}\n\n// Function to create hash values for a string\nvector<int> createhash(string A) {\n  // Compute hash values for the string A using the precomputed power values\n  vector<int> x;\n  for (int i = 0; i < A.length(); i++) {\n    x.push_back(((A[i] - 97) * power[i]) % 1000000007);\n  }\n  // Compute rolling hash values for the string A\n  for (int i = 1; i < A.length(); i++) {\n    x[i] = (x[i] + x[i - 1]) % 1000000007;\n  }\n  return x;\n}\n\n// Function to create hash values for a string with a different modulus\nvector<int> createhash1(string A) {\n  // Compute hash values for the string A using the precomputed power values\n  vector<int> x;\n  for (int i = 0; i < A.length(); i++) {\n    x.push_back(((A[i] - 97) * powerx[i]) % 15487019);\n  }\n  // Compute rolling hash values for the string A\n  for (int i = 1; i < A.length(); i++) {\n    x[i] = (x[i] + x[i - 1]) % 15487019;\n  }\n  return x;\n}\n\n// Function to compute modular inverse\nlong long modinv(long long a) { return modexp(a, 1000000007 - 2); }\n\n// Function to compute modular inverse with a different modulus\nlong long modinvx(long long a) { return modexpx(a, 15487019 - 2); }\n\n// Function to find the longest common prefix between two substrings\nint findlcp(int x, int y) {\n  // Adjust indices x and y to 0-based\n  x--;\n  y--;\n  // Initialize search space for the longest common prefix\n  int low = 1, high = min(hashA.size() - x, hashB.size() - y) + 1;\n  // Binary search for the longest common prefix\n  while (low < high) {\n    int mid = (low + high) / 2;\n    // Compute hash values for the substrings ending at x and y\n    long long hasheqA =\n        (((hashA[x + mid - 1] - (x? hashA[x - 1] : 0) + 1000000007) %\n          1000000007) *\n         inv[x + 1]) %\n        1000000007;\n    long long hasheqB =\n        (((hashB[y + mid - 1] - (y? hashB[y - 1] : 0) + 1000000007) %\n          1000000007) *\n         inv[y + 1]) %\n        1000000007;\n    long long hasheqA2 =\n        (((hashAx[x + mid - 1] - (x? hashAx[x - 1] : 0) + 15487019) %\n          15487019) *\n         invx[x + 1]) %\n        15487019;\n    long long hasheqB2 =\n        (((hashBx[y + mid - 1] - (y? hashBx[y - 1] : 0) + 15487019) %\n          15487019) *\n         invx[y + 1]) %\n        15487019;\n    // Check if the hash values match\n    if (hasheqA!= hasheqB || hasheqB2!= hasheqA2)\n      high = mid;\n    else\n      low = mid + 1;\n  }\n  // Return the length of the longest common prefix\n  return low - 1;\n}\n\nint main() {\n  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n  // Read input values\n  int n, m, x;\n  string A, B;\n  cin >> n;\n  cin >> A;\n  cin >> m;\n  cin >> B;\n  cin >> x;\n  // Precompute power values and their modular inverses\n  for (int i = 0; i <= max(A.length(), B.length()); i++) {\n    power[i] = modexp(59, i);\n    powerx[i] = modexpx(67, i);\n  }\n  for (int i = 0; i <= max(A.length(), B.length()); i++) {\n    inv[i] = modinv(power[i]);\n    invx[i] = modinvx(powerx[i]);\n  }\n  // Create hash values for the strings A and B\n  hashA = createhash(A);\n  hashB = createhash(B);\n  hashAx = createhash1(A);\n  hashBx = createhash1(B);\n  // Initialize dynamic programming table\n  memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));\n  dp[0][0] = 0;\n  // Fill the dynamic programming table\n  for (int i = 0; i <= A.length(); i++)\n    for (int j = 0; j <= x; j++) {\n      dp[i + 1][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j]);\n      int lcp = findlcp(i + 1, dp[i][j] + 1);\n      dp[i + lcp][j + 1] = max(dp[i][j] + lcp, dp[i + lcp][j + 1]);\n    }\n  // Check if the final value in the dynamic programming table is equal to m\n  if (dp[A.length()][x] == B.length())\n    cout << \"YES\\n\";\n  else\n    cout << \"NO\\n\";\n}\n```",

Each pair of familiar students is connected to the source node, and each student is connected to the sink node.\n2. Add edges to the flow network: We add edges to the flow network to represent the pairs of familiar students. Each edge has a capacity of 1, and we also add reverse edges to ensure that the flow network is symmetric.\n3.

The maximum flow represents the minimum number of souvenirs that the unluckiest student will have to present.\n4. Determine the number of souvenirs for each student: We iterate through the flow network and count the number of edges that have a flow of 1.

In their opinion, it would be good if the first-year students presented small souvenirs to each other. When they voiced this idea to the first-year students, they found out the following:\n\n  * some pairs of the new students already know each other; \n  * each new student agrees to give souvenirs only to those with whom they are already familiar; \n  * each new student does not want to present too many souvenirs. \n\n\n\nThe organizers have written down all the pairs of first-year friends who are familiar with each other and now want to determine for each new student, whom they should give souvenirs to. In their opinion, in each pair of familiar students exactly one student must present a souvenir to another student.\n\nFirst year students already decided to call the unluckiest the one who will have to present the greatest number of souvenirs. The organizers in return promised that the unluckiest will be unlucky to the minimum possible degree: of course, they will have to present the greatest number of souvenirs compared to the other students, but this number will be as small as possible.\n\nOrganizers are very busy, and they asked you to determine for each pair of first-year friends who and to whom should present a souvenir.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5000, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 min(5000, n\u00b7(n - 1) / 2)) \u2014 the number of the first year students and the number of pairs of the students that know each other.

The c-th cell in the r-th row is denoted by (r, c).\n\nOshino places and removes barriers around rectangular areas of cells. Specifically, an action denoted by \"1 r1 c1 r2 c2\" means Oshino's placing barriers around a rectangle with two corners being (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) and sides parallel to squares sides.

Oshino ensures that no barriers staying on the ground share any common points, nor do they intersect with boundaries of the n \u00d7 m area.\n\nSometimes Koyomi tries to walk from one cell to another carefully without striding over barriers, in order to avoid damaging various items on the ground. \"3 r1 c1 r2 c2\" means that Koyomi tries to walk from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2) without crossing barriers.\n\nAnd you're here to tell Koyomi the feasibility of each of his attempts.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains three space-separated integers n, m and q (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2 500, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the grid, and the total number of Oshino and Koyomi's actions, respectively.\n\nThe following q lines each describes an action, containing five space-separated integers t, r1, c1, r2, c2 (1 \u2264 t \u2264 3, 1 \u2264 r1, r2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c1, c2 \u2264 m) \u2014 the type and two coordinates of an action.

        "instruction": "Arkady wants to have a dinner. He has just returned from a shop where he has bought a semifinished cutlet. He only needs to fry it. The cutlet should be fried for 2n seconds, in particular, it should be fried for n seconds on one side and n seconds on the other side. Arkady has already got a frying pan and turn on fire, but understood that maybe he won't be able to flip the cutlet exactly after n seconds after the beginning of cooking.\n\nArkady is too busy with sorting sticker packs in his favorite messenger and can flip the cutlet only in some periods of time. Namely, there are k periods of time in which he can do it, the i-th of them is an interval of time from li seconds after he starts cooking till ri seconds, inclusive. Arkady decided that it's not required to flip the cutlet exactly in the middle of cooking, instead, he will flip it several times in such a way that the cutlet will be fried exactly n seconds on one side and n seconds on the other side in total.\n\nHelp Arkady and find out if it's possible for him to cook the cutlet, if he is able to flip the cutlet only in given periods of time; and if yes, find the minimum number of flips he needs to cook the cutlet.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of seconds the cutlet should be cooked on each side and number of periods of time in which Arkady can flip it.\n\nThe next k lines contain descriptions of these intervals. Each line contains two integers li and ri (0 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 2\u00b7n), meaning that Arkady can flip the cutlet in any moment starting from li seconds after the beginning of cooking and finishing at ri seconds after beginning of cooking. In particular, if li = ri then Arkady can flip the cutlet only in the moment li = ri. It's guaranteed that li > ri - 1 for all 2 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput \"Hungry\" if Arkady won't be able to fry the cutlet for exactly n seconds on one side and exactly n seconds on the other side.\n\nOtherwise, output \"Full\" in the first line, and the minimum number of times he should flip the cutlet in the second line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n10 2\n3 5\n11 13\n\n\nOutput\n\nFull\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n10 3\n3 5\n9 10\n11 13\n\n\nOutput\n\nFull\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n20 1\n3 19\n\n\nOutput\n\nHungry\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example Arkady should flip the cutlet in time moment 3 seconds after he starts cooking and in time moment 13 seconds after he starts cooking.\n\nIn the second example, Arkady can flip the cutlet at 10 seconds after he starts cooking.",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input values n and k, which represent the number of seconds the cutlet should be cooked on each side and the number of periods of time in which Arkady can flip it.\n2. Initialize a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of flips required to cook the cutlet for each possible time j and each possible state (0 or 1) of the cutlet.\n3. Read the intervals in which Arkady can flip the cutlet and store them in the array a.\n4. Initialize the dp array with a large value (1e9) to represent an impossible solution.\n5. Set the base case for the dp array: dp[1][0][0] = 0, which means that if the cutlet is not flipped at all, the minimum number of flips is 0.\n6. Iterate over the intervals in which Arkady can flip the cutlet.\n7. For each interval, calculate the difference del between the start of the current interval and the end of the previous interval.\n8. Update the dp array by considering the following cases:\n   - If the current time j is greater than or equal to del, the minimum number of flips is the same as the minimum number of flips for the previous interval.\n   - Otherwise, the minimum number of flips is set to a large value (1e9).\n9. Use a priority queue q to store the minimum number of flips for each possible time j.\n10. Iterate over the intervals in which Arkady can flip the cutlet and update the dp array by considering the following cases:\n   - If the current time j is less than or equal to the end of the current interval, update the minimum number of flips for the current time j.\n   - If the current time j is greater than the end of the current interval, remove the corresponding element from the priority queue q.\n11.

Iterate through the intervals in reverse order (from K-1 to 0).\n6. For each interval, iterate through the possible times l (from max(0, A[i].first - N) to min(A[i].first, N)).\n7. For each time l, calculate the minimum number of flips required to cook the cutlet by considering three cases:\n   - Case 1: Flip the cutlet at time l + (N << 1) - A[i].first.\n   - Case 2: Flip the cutlet at time l + (A[i].second - A[i].first).\n   - Case 3: Flip the cutlet at time l + (N << 1) - A[i].second.\n8. Update the dp array with the minimum number of flips required for each time l.\n9. Build a segment tree to efficiently query the minimum number of flips required for a given time l.\n10. Query the segment tree to find the minimum number of flips required to cook the cutlet for time N.\n11. If the minimum number of flips required is less than inf, output \"Full\" and the minimum number of flips required. Otherwise, output \"Hungry\".\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst long long mod = 1000000007;\nconst int mxN = 100010;\nconst int mxK = 110;\nconst int inf = mxN << 4;\n\n// 2D array to store the minimum number of flips required for each time l\nint dp[2][mxN];\n\n// Segment tree to efficiently query the minimum number of flips required for a given time l\nint tree[2][mxN << 2];\n\n// Array to store the intervals of time in which Arkady can flip the cutlet\npair<int, int> A[mxK];\n\nint N;\n\n// Function to build the segment tree\nvoid build(int n = 1, int l = 0, int r = N) {\n  // Base case: If the current node is a leaf node, set its value in the segment tree\n  if (l == r) {\n    tree[0][n] = dp[0][l];\n    tree[1][n] = dp[1][l];\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Recursively build the segment tree for the left and right subtrees\n  int md = (l + r) >> 1;\n  build(n << 1, l, md);\n  build(n << 1 | 1, md + 1, r);\n\n  // Update the values in the segment tree\n  tree[0][n] = min(tree[0][n << 1], tree[0][n << 1 | 1]);\n  tree[1][n] = min(tree[1][n << 1], tree[1][n << 1 | 1]);\n}\n\n// Function to query the segment tree for the minimum number of flips required for a given time l\nint getSeg(int d, int a, int b, int n = 1, int l = 0, int r = N) {\n  // Base case: If the query range is empty, return inf\n  if (l == a && r == b) return tree[d][n];\n\n  // Recursively query the segment tree for the left and right subtrees\n  int md = (l + r) >> 1;\n  int res = inf;\n  if (a <= md) res = getSeg(d, a, min(b, md), n << 1, l, md);\n  if (b > md)\n    res = min(res, getSeg(d, max(a, md + 1), b, n << 1 | 1, md + 1, r));\n\n  // Return the minimum number of flips required\n  return res;\n}\n\n// Function to query the segment tree for the minimum number of flips required for a given time l\nint get(int i, int d, int a, int b) {\n  // Adjust the query range to account for the current interval\n  a = max(a, max(0, A[i + 1].first - N));\n  b = min(b, min(A[i + 1].first, N));\n\n  // If the query range is empty, return inf\n  if (a > b) return inf;\n\n  // Query the segment tree for the minimum number of flips required\n  return getSeg(d, a, b);\n}\n\nint main() {\n  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n  cin.tie(nullptr);\n\n  // Read the input values for N and K\n  int K;\n  cin >> N >> K;\n\n  // Initialize the array A to store the intervals of time in which Arkady can flip the cutlet\n  for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) cin >> A[i].first >> A[i].second;\n\n  // Iterate through the intervals in reverse order\n  for (int i = K - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    // Iterate through the possible times l\n    for (int l = max(0, A[i].first - N); l <= min(A[i].first, N); l++) {\n      // Initialize the minimum number of flips required for the current time l\n      dp[0][l] = dp[1][l] = inf;\n\n      // Calculate the minimum number of flips required for the current time l\n      if (i == K - 1) {\n        // Case 1: Flip the cutlet at time l + (N << 1) - A[i].first\n        if (l + (N << 1) - A[i].first == N)\n          dp[0][l] = 0;\n        else if (N <= l + (A[i].second - A[i].first))\n          dp[0][l] = 1;\n        else if (N <= 1 + (N << 1) - A[i].first &&\n                 N >= l + (N << 1) - A[i].second)\n          dp[0][l] = 2;\n\n        // Case 2: Flip the cutlet at time l\n        if (l == N)\n          dp[1][l] = 0;\n        else if (N <= l + (N << 1) - A[i].first &&\n                 N >= l + (N << 1) - A[i].second)\n          dp[1][l] = 1;\n        else if (N <= l + (A[i].second - A[i].first))\n          dp[1][l] = 2;\n        continue;\n      }\n\n      // Calculate the minimum number of flips required for the current time l\n      dp[0][l] = min(dp[0][l], get(i, 0, l + A[i + 1].first - A[i].first,\n                                   l + A[i + 1].first - A[i].first));\n      dp[0][l] = min(dp[0][l], 1 + get(i, 1, l, l + A[i].second - A[i].first));\n      dp[0][l] = min(dp[0][l], 2 + get(i, 0, l + A[i + 1].first - A[i].second,\n                                       l + A[i + 1].first - A[i].first));\n\n      dp[1][l] = min(dp[1][l], get(i, 1, l, l));\n      dp[1][l] = min(dp[1][l], 1 + get(i, 0, l + A[i + 1].first - A[i].second,\n                                       l + A[i + 1].first - A[i].first));\n      dp[1][l] = min(dp[1][l], 2 + get(i, 1, l, l + A[i].second - A[i].first));\n    }\n\n    // Build the segment tree\n    build();\n  }\n\n  // Query the segment tree to find the minimum number of flips required to cook the cutlet for time N\n  int res = min(get(-1, 0, A[0].first, A[0].first), get(-1, 1, 0, 0));\n\n  // Output the result\n  (res < inf? cout << \"Full\\n\" << res << '\\n' : cout << \"Hungry\\n\");\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

        "instruction": "Arkady wants to have a dinner. He has just returned from a shop where he has bought a semifinished cutlet. He only needs to fry it. The cutlet should be fried for 2n seconds, in particular, it should be fried for n seconds on one side and n seconds on the other side. Arkady has already got a frying pan and turn on fire, but understood that maybe he won't be able to flip the cutlet exactly after n seconds after the beginning of cooking.\n\nArkady is too busy with sorting sticker packs in his favorite messenger and can flip the cutlet only in some periods of time. Namely, there are k periods of time in which he can do it, the i-th of them is an interval of time from li seconds after he starts cooking till ri seconds, inclusive. Arkady decided that it's not required to flip the cutlet exactly in the middle of cooking, instead, he will flip it several times in such a way that the cutlet will be fried exactly n seconds on one side and n seconds on the other side in total.\n\nHelp Arkady and find out if it's possible for him to cook the cutlet, if he is able to flip the cutlet only in given periods of time; and if yes, find the minimum number of flips he needs to cook the cutlet.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of seconds the cutlet should be cooked on each side and number of periods of time in which Arkady can flip it.\n\nThe next k lines contain descriptions of these intervals. Each line contains two integers li and ri (0 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 2\u00b7n), meaning that Arkady can flip the cutlet in any moment starting from li seconds after the beginning of cooking and finishing at ri seconds after beginning of cooking. In particular, if li = ri then Arkady can flip the cutlet only in the moment li = ri. It's guaranteed that li > ri - 1 for all 2 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput \"Hungry\" if Arkady won't be able to fry the cutlet for exactly n seconds on one side and exactly n seconds on the other side.\n\nOtherwise, output \"Full\" in the first line, and the minimum number of times he should flip the cutlet in the second line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n10 2\n3 5\n11 13\n\n\nOutput\n\nFull\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n10 3\n3 5\n9 10\n11 13\n\n\nOutput\n\nFull\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n20 1\n3 19\n\n\nOutput\n\nHungry\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example Arkady should flip the cutlet in time moment 3 seconds after he starts cooking and in time moment 13 seconds after he starts cooking.\n\nIn the second example, Arkady can flip the cutlet at 10 seconds after he starts cooking.",

Initialize a 2D array dp with size 2x(maxn) to store the minimum number of flips required for each subproblem. Set all elements in dp to INF (infinity).\n3. Set dp[0][0] to 0, as no flips are required for a cutlet that has not been cooked yet.\n4. Iterate through each period of time (i = 0 to k-1) in which Arkady can flip the cutlet.\n5. For each period, update the dp array for the next state (nxt) by copying the values from the current state (now).\n6. Process the current period by iterating through each possible time j from 0 to r (the end time of the current period).\n7. Maintain a queue q to store the times at which the minimum number of flips is achieved. Initialize h and t to 0.\n8. Iterate through the queue q and update the dp array for the next state (nxt) by considering the minimum number of flips required for each subproblem.\n9. Swap the current state (now) and the next state (nxt) to prepare for the next period.\n10. After processing all periods, check if the minimum number of flips required for the cutlet to be cooked for n seconds on each side is less than or equal to INF.

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. First, we check if the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive is when he chooses x to be M. This is because choosing x to be M ensures that Arkady receives the maximum number of candies without violating the constraints of the problem. We calculate this by dividing the total number of candies (n) by M and then multiplying the result by the maximum number of times a person can receive candies (D) while considering the number of people (k). We use the ceiling division operator (//) to round up to the nearest whole number, as we cannot have a fraction of a candy.\n\n2. If the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive when choosing x to be M is less than or equal to the total number of candies, we update the result (res) with this value.\n\n3. Next, we iterate through the possible values of x from 2 to D (inclusive). For each value of x, we calculate the number of days it takes to distribute all the candies among the people. We use the formula n // ((day-1)*k+1) to calculate this, where n is the total number of candies, day is the current iteration, and k is the number of people.\n\n4. If the calculated value of x is less than or equal to M, we update the result (res) with the maximum of the current result and the product of x and the current day.\n\n5. Finally, we print the result (res), which represents the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n# Read the input values from the user\nn, k, M, D = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Initialize the result variable to 0\nres = 0\n\n# Check if the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive is when he chooses x to be M\nif (n//M + k - 1) // k <= D:  # Calculate the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive when choosing x to be M\n    res = M * ((n//M + k - 1) // k)  # Update the result with this value\n\n# Iterate through the possible values of x from 2 to D (inclusive)\nfor day in range(2, D + 1):\n    x = n // ((day-1)*k+1)  # Calculate the number of candies Arkady can receive on each day\n    if x <= M:  # Check if the calculated value of x is less than or equal to M\n        res = max(res, x * day)  # Update the result with the maximum of the current result and the product of x and the current day\n\n# Print the result, which represents the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive\nprint(res)\n```",

The fruit only grows in vertices of the tree other than the root. Each vertex contains at most one piece of fruit.\n\nIt is now day 0 and no fruit is ripe yet. Each fruit will only be ripe for a single day. For each fruit, we are given the vertex v_j where it grows, the day d_j on which it will be ripe, and the amount w_j of magic juice we can extract from it if we harvest it when it is ripe.\n\nThe fruits have to be harvested by cutting some branches of the tree. On each day, you may cut as many branches of the tree as you like. The parts of the tree you cut off will fall to the ground and you can collect all the ripe fruits they contain. All fruits that fall to the ground when they are not ripe are discarded and no magic juice is collected from them.\n\nFormally, on each day, you may erase some edges of the tree. Whenever you do so, the tree will split into multiple connected components. You then erase all components that do not contain the root and you harvest all ripe fruits those components contained.\n\nGiven is a description of the tree together with the locations, ripening days and juiciness of all m fruits. Calculate the maximum total amount of magic juice we can harvest from the tree.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100,000), m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n-1) and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100,000) \u2013 the number of vertices, the number of fruits, and the maximum day on which a fruit may become ripe.\n\nThe following n-1 lines contain the integers p_2, ..., p_n, one per line. For each i (from 2 to n, inclusive), vertex p_i (1 \u2264 p_i \u2264 i-1) is the parent of vertex i.\n\nEach of the last m lines describes one fruit. The j-th of these lines has the form \"v_j\\ d_j\\ w_j\" (2 \u2264 v_j \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 d_j \u2264 k, 1 \u2264 w_j \u2264 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that no vertex contains more than one fruit (i.e., the values v_j are distinct).\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single line with a single integer, the maximum amount of magic juice we can harvest from the tree.\n\nScoring\n\nSubtask 1 (6 points): n, k \u2264 20, and w_j = 1 for all j\n\nSubtask 2 (3 points): fruits only grow in the leaves of the tree\n\nSubtask 3 (11 points): p_i = i-1 for each i, and w_j = 1 for all j\n\nSubtask 4 (12 points): k \u2264 2\n\nSubtask 5 (16 points): k \u2264 20, and w_j = 1 for all j\n\nSubtask 6 (13 points): m \u2264 1,000\n\nSubtask 7 (22 points): w_j = 1 for all j\n\nSubtask 8 (17 points): no additional constraints\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6 4 10\n1\n2\n1\n4\n4\n3 4 5\n4 7 2\n5 4 1\n6 9 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n\nNote\n\nIn the example input, one optimal solution looks as follows: \n\n  * On day 4, cut the edge between vertices 4 and 5 and harvest a ripe fruit with 1 unit of magic juice. On the same day, cut the edge between vertices 1 and 2 and harvest 5 units of magic juice from the ripe fruit in vertex 3. \n  * On day 7, do nothing. (We could harvest the fruit in vertex 4 that just became ripe, but doing so is not optimal.) \n  * On day 9, cut the edge between vertices 1 and 4. Discard the fruit in vertex 4 that is no longer ripe, and harvest 3 units of magic juice from the ripe fruit in vertex 6. (Alternately, we could achieve the same effect by cutting the edge between vertices 4 and 6.) ",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input: The first line contains three space-separated integers n (number of vertices), m (number of fruits), and k (maximum day on which a fruit may become ripe). The following n-1 lines contain the integers p_2,..., p_n, one per line, representing the parent of each vertex. Each of the last m lines describes one fruit with the form \"v_j\\ d_j\\ w_j\" (vertex, day, and weight of the fruit).\n2. Create a magic tree data structure: Use a segment tree to efficiently manage the tree and its fruits. The segment tree will store the total weight of fruits in each subtree.\n3. Initialize the segment tree: Create a new node for each fruit and insert it into the segment tree. The key of each node is the day on which the fruit will be ripe, and the priority is a random number to break ties.\n4. Define the merge operation: When merging two nodes, combine their subtrees and update the total weight of fruits in the resulting node.\n5. Define the split operation: Split the segment tree at a given key (day) and return the left and right subtrees.\n6. Define the split size operation: Split the segment tree at a given key (day) and return the size of the left and right subtrees.\n7. Define the split key operation: Split the segment tree at a given key (day) and return the left and right subtrees.\n8. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree: Traverse the tree and for each vertex, merge the segment trees of its children and update the segment tree of the vertex.\n9. Insert fruits into the segment tree: For each fruit, split the segment tree at the day on which the fruit will be ripe, insert the fruit into the resulting left subtree, and merge the left and right subtrees.\n10.

Calculate `l` array: Iterate over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `v`, if it is greater than the previous element `a[-i]`, update `l[i]` as `l[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, update `l[i]` as 1.\n4. Calculate `r` array: Iterate over the array `a` in normal order. For each element `v`, if it is less than the previous element `a[i - 1]`, update `r[i]` as `r[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, update `r[i]` as 1.\n5. Find the maximum length of the increasing subarray: Initialize `ans` as the maximum value in the `l` array.\n6. Check for the maximum length with one element removal: Iterate over the array `a` from the second element to the second last element.
