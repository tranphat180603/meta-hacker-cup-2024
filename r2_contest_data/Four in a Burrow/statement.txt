Connie and Forrest are playing [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) for bunnies by making burrows on a grid of $42$ plots of land with $6$ rows and $7$ columns. Connie goes first, and the two of them alternate turns. 

On Connie's turn, she selects a column and makes a burrow in that column's southernmost unburrowed plot, marking it as her own. Forrest then does the same thing, making a burrow in the southernmost unburrowed plot in some column. Once all $6$ plots in a column have been burrowed, players can no longer choose that column.

Normally, the game ends as soon as one player has four consecutive burrows in a line (horizontally, vertically, or [diagonally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN3nohBw_CE)). That player is then declared the winner. However, the bunnies had so much fun burrowing that they didn't stop taking turns until every plot was burrowed. Theyâ€™re now trying to work out who won.

Given the final $6 \times 7$ grid of '`C`' and '`F`' markings (denoting plots burrowed by Connie and Forrest respectively), can you tell who must have won first?

Please output:
* `C`: if Connie must have won first
* `F`: if Forrest must have won first
* `?`: if somebody has won, but it's impossible to tell who won first
* `0`: if nobody has won

# Constraints
\(1 \leq T \leq 90\)

Every input grid will be the result of Connie and Forrest taking turns, with Connie going first, until all $42$ plots have been burrowed.

# Input Format
Input begins with an integer \(T\), the number of test cases. Each case starts with an empty line for readability, and then $6$ rows of $7$ characters each, representing the final state of the game. The bottom row is the southern-most row.

# Output Format
For the \(i\)th test case, print "`Case #i:` " followed by a single character denoting who won first (if anybody, and if we can tell for sure), as described above.

# Sample Explanation
In the first case, any time Forrest has four burrows in a row, Connie must already have four burrows in a row, so Connie must have won first.

In the second case, it's not clear who won first. Here are two possible ways the game may have progressed, with Connie winning the first way and Forrest winning the second way:

In the fourth case, nobody has four burrows in a row, so nobody has won.
