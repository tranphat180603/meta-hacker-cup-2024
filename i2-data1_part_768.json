Each of them has a single number written on it \u2014 either 1 or 2.\n\nHowever, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.\n\nCan you win the prize?

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n\n1. First, we need to generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit (800005 in this case). We use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to achieve this.\n2. Next, we count the number of 1s and 2s in the input sequence.\n3. We then initialize an empty list `ans` to store the final permutation of numbers.\n4. We start with an initial prefix sum `cur` of 0 and an index `nxt` pointing to the first prime number in the list `prm`.\n5. We enter a loop that continues until we have used up all the numbers in the input sequence or we have exhausted the list of prime numbers.\n6. Inside the loop, we calculate the difference `reqd` between the next prime number and the current prefix sum.\n7. We then check if we have enough 1s and 2s to satisfy the requirement `reqd`. If not, we append the remaining 1s and 2s to the `ans` list and break out of the loop.\n8. If we have enough numbers, we start appending numbers to the `ans` list to satisfy the requirement `reqd`. We prioritize using 2s over 1s to maximize the number of prime prefix sums.\n9. Once we have satisfied the requirement `reqd`, we update the prefix sum `cur` to the next prime number and move to the next prime number in the list `prm`.\n10. Finally, we print the `ans` list, which contains the permutation of numbers that maximizes the number of prime prefix sums.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n# Generate a list of prime numbers up to 800005 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm\nsie = [1]*(800005)  # Initialize a list of boolean values to track primality\nsie[0] = 0  # 0 is not a prime number\nsie[1] = 0  # 1 is not a prime number\nfor i in range(2, 800005):  # Iterate from 2 to 800005\n    if sie[i]:  # If i is a prime number\n        for j in range(i*i, 800005, i):  # Mark multiples of i as non-prime\n            sie[j] = 0\n\n# Create a list of prime numbers\nprm = []  # Initialize an empty list to store prime numbers\nfor i in range(400005):  # Iterate from 0 to 400004\n    if sie[i]:  # If i is a prime number\n        prm.append(i)  # Add i to the list of prime numbers\n\n# Read input and count the number of 1s and 2s\nn = int(input())  # Read the number of elements in the input sequence\nA = [int(i) for i in input().split()]  # Read the input sequence\nones = A.count(1)  # Count the number of 1s\ntwos = n-ones  # Count the number of 2s\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the final permutation\nans = []\n\n# Initialize variables to track the current prefix sum and the next prime number\ncur = 0\nnxt = 0\n\nwhile True:  # Loop until we have used up all the numbers or exhausted the list of prime numbers\n    # Calculate the difference between the next prime number and the current prefix sum\n    reqd = prm[nxt] - cur\n\n    # Check if we have enough 1s and 2s to satisfy the requirement\n    if ones + 2*twos < reqd:\n        # If not, append the remaining 1s and 2s to the ans list and break out of the loop\n        for i in range(ones):\n            ans.append(1)\n        for i in range(twos):\n            ans.append(2)\n        break\n    else:\n        # If we have enough numbers, start appending numbers to the ans list to satisfy the requirement\n        while reqd > 0:\n            # Prioritize using 2s over 1s to maximize the number of prime prefix sums\n            if reqd == 2 and twos:\n                ans.append(2)\n                reqd -= 2\n                twos -= 1\n            elif reqd == 1 and ones:\n                ans.append(1)\n                reqd -= 1\n                ones -= 1\n            else:\n                # If we have more 2s, use them to satisfy the requirement\n                if twos:\n                    reqd -= 2\n                    ans.append(2)\n                    twos -= 1\n                # If we have more 1s, use them to satisfy the requirement\n                elif ones:\n                    reqd -= 1\n                    ans.append(1)\n                    ones -= 1\n                # If we have neither 1s nor 2s, break out of the loop\n                else:\n                    break\n\n    # Update the prefix sum and move to the next prime number\n    cur = prm[nxt]\n    nxt += 1\n    if nxt >= len(prm):\n        break\n\n# Print the final permutation\nprint(*ans)\n```",

        "instruction": "Let's define a number ebne (even but not even) if and only if its sum of digits is divisible by 2 but the number itself is not divisible by 2. For example, 13, 1227, 185217 are ebne numbers, while 12, 2, 177013, 265918 are not. If you're still unsure what ebne numbers are, you can look at the sample notes for more clarification.\n\nYou are given a non-negative integer s, consisting of n digits. You can delete some digits (they are not necessary consecutive/successive) to make the given number ebne. You cannot change the order of the digits, that is, after deleting the digits the remaining digits collapse. The resulting number shouldn't contain leading zeros. You can delete any number of digits between 0 (do not delete any digits at all) and n-1.\n\nFor example, if you are given s=222373204424185217171912 then one of possible ways to make it ebne is: 222373204424185217171912 \u2192 2237344218521717191. The sum of digits of 2237344218521717191 is equal to 70 and is divisible by 2, but number itself is not divisible by 2: it means that the resulting number is ebne.\n\nFind any resulting number that is ebne. If it's impossible to create an ebne number from the given number report about it.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000) \u2014 the number of digits in the original number.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a non-negative integer number s, consisting of n digits.\n\nIt is guaranteed that s does not contain leading zeros and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3000.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case given in the input print the answer in the following format:\n\n  * If it is impossible to create an ebne number, print \"-1\" (without quotes);\n  * Otherwise, print the resulting number after deleting some, possibly zero, but not all digits. This number should be ebne. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. Note that answers with leading zeros or empty strings are not accepted. It's not necessary to minimize or maximize the number of deleted digits.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n1227\n1\n0\n6\n177013\n24\n222373204424185217171912\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1227\n-1\n17703\n2237344218521717191\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case of the example, 1227 is already an ebne number (as 1 + 2 + 2 + 7 = 12, 12 is divisible by 2, while in the same time, 1227 is not divisible by 2) so we don't need to delete any digits. Answers such as 127 and 17 will also be accepted.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, it is clearly impossible to create an ebne number from the given number.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, there are many ebne numbers we can obtain by deleting, for example, 1 digit such as 17703, 77013 or 17013. Answers such as 1701 or 770 will not be accepted as they are not ebne numbers. Answer 013 will not be accepted as it contains leading zeroes.\n\nExplanation:\n\n  * 1 + 7 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 18. As 18 is divisible by 2 while 17703 is not divisible by 2, we can see that 17703 is an ebne number. Same with 77013 and 17013;\n  * 1 + 7 + 0 + 1 = 9. Because 9 is not divisible by 2, 1701 is not an ebne number;\n  * 7 + 7 + 0 = 14. This time, 14 is divisible by 2 but 770 is also divisible by 2, therefore, 770 is not an ebne number.\n\n\n\nIn the last test case of the example, one of many other possible answers is given.

It's not necessary to minimize or maximize the number of deleted digits.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4\n1227\n1\n0\n6\n177013\n24\n222373204424185217171912\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1227\n-1\n17703\n2237344218521717191\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case of the example, 1227 is already an ebne number (as 1 + 2 + 2 + 7 = 12, 12 is divisible by 2, while in the same time, 1227 is not divisible by 2) so we don't need to delete any digits. Answers such as 127 and 17 will also be accepted.\n\nIn the second test case of the example, it is clearly impossible to create an ebne number from the given number.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, there are many ebne numbers we can obtain by deleting, for example, 1 digit such as 17703, 77013 or 17013. Answers such as 1701 or 770 will not be accepted as they are not ebne numbers. Answer 013 will not be accepted as it contains leading zeroes.\n\nExplanation:\n\n  * 1 + 7 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 18. As 18 is divisible by 2 while 17703 is not divisible by 2, we can see that 17703 is an ebne number. Same with 77013 and 17013;\n  * 1 + 7 + 0 + 1 = 9. Because 9 is not divisible by 2, 1701 is not an ebne number;\n  * 7 + 7 + 0 = 14. This time, 14 is divisible by 2 but 770 is also divisible by 2, therefore, 770 is not an ebne number.\n\n\n\nIn the last test case of the example, one of many other possible answers is given. Another possible answer is: 222373204424185217171912 \u2192 22237320442418521717191 (delete the last digit).",

A winner of each tour gets a huge prize. The school is organised quite far away, so one will have to take all the prizes home in one go. And the bags that you've brought with you have space for no more than k huge prizes.\n\nBesides the fact that you want to take all the prizes home, you also want to perform well. You will consider your performance good if you win at least l tours.\n\nIn fact, years of organizing contests proved to the organizers that transporting huge prizes is an issue for the participants.

        "instruction": "In the autumn of this year, two Russian teams came into the group stage of the most prestigious football club competition in the world \u2014 the UEFA Champions League. Now, these teams have already started to play in the group stage and are fighting for advancing to the playoffs. In this problem we are interested in the draw stage, the process of sorting teams into groups.\n\nThe process of the draw goes as follows (the rules that are described in this problem, are somehow simplified compared to the real life). Suppose n teams will take part in the group stage (n is divisible by four). The teams should be divided into groups of four. Let's denote the number of groups as m (<image>). Each team has a rating \u2014 an integer characterizing the team's previous achievements. The teams are sorted by the rating's decreasing (no two teams have the same rating).\n\nAfter that four \"baskets\" are formed, each of which will contain m teams: the first m teams with the highest rating go to the first basket, the following m teams go to the second one, and so on.\n\nThen the following procedure repeats m - 1 times. A team is randomly taken from each basket, first from the first basket, then from the second, then from the third, and at last, from the fourth. The taken teams form another group. After that, they are removed from their baskets.\n\nThe four teams remaining in the baskets after (m - 1) such procedures are performed, form the last group.\n\nIn the real draw the random selection of teams from the basket is performed by people \u2014 as a rule, the well-known players of the past. As we have none, we will use a random number generator, which is constructed as follows. Its parameters are four positive integers x, a, b, c. Every time there is a call to the random number generator, it produces the following actions:\n\n  * calculates <image>; \n  * replaces parameter x by value y (assigns <image>); \n  * returns x as another random number. \n\n\n\nOperation <image> means taking the remainder after division: <image>, <image>.\n\nA random number generator will be used in the draw as follows: each time we need to randomly choose a team from the basket, it will generate a random number k. The teams that yet remain in the basket are considered numbered with consecutive integers from 0 to s - 1, in the order of decreasing rating, where s is the current size of the basket. Then a team number <image> is taken from the basket.\n\nGiven a list of teams and the parameters of the random number generator, determine the result of the draw. \n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains integer n (4 \u2264 n \u2264 64, n is divisible by four) \u2014 the number of teams that take part in the sorting. The second line contains four space-separated integers x, a, b, c (1 \u2264 x, a, b, c \u2264 1000) \u2014 the parameters of the random number generator. Each of the following n lines describes one team. The description consists of the name of the team and its rating, separated by a single space. The name of a team consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and has length from 1 to 20 characters. A team's rating is an integer from 0 to 1000. All teams' names are distinct. All team's ratings are also distinct.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the way the teams must be sorted into groups. Print the groups in the order, in which they are formed in the sorting. Number the groups by consecutive uppercase English letters, starting from letter 'A'. Inside each group print the teams' names one per line, in the order of decreasing of the teams' rating.

Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each type of coin i that has not been marked as having fewer coins (i.e., d[i] == 0). During the DFS, increment the count of valid combinations and update the amount of cents remaining (t) by subtracting the worth of the current type of coin multiplied by the number of coins of that type.\n5. If the DFS reaches a point where t becomes negative or the count of valid combinations is less than n, it means that there are no valid combinations of coins that satisfy Bessie's conditions, so print 0 and exit.\n6. Initialize the dp array to store the number of valid combinations for each amount of cents from 0 to t. Set dp[0] = 1, as there is exactly one way to have 0 cents (i.e., no coins).\n7. Iterate through each type of coin i from 1 to n. For each amount of cents j from a[i] to t, update dp[j] by adding dp[j - a[i]] modulo MOD. This represents the number of valid combinations for j cents by considering the current type of coin i.\n8. Finally, print the value of dp[t] modulo MOD, which represents the total number of valid combinations of coins that Bessie could have.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int MOD = 1000000007; // modulo value\nconst int MAXN = 305; // maximum number of types of coins\nconst int MAXT = 100005; // maximum amount of cents\n\nint a[MAXN], e[MAXN], d[MAXN]; // arrays to store coin values, relationships, and flags\nlong long dp[MAXT]; // array to store number of valid combinations for each amount of cents\n\n// function to perform depth-first search\nvoid dfs(int u, int acc) {\n  // if the amount of cents remaining is negative, return\n  if (t < 0) {\n    return;\n  }\n  // increment the count of valid combinations\n  ++cnt;\n  // update the number of coins of type u\n  a[u] += acc;\n  // if there is a relationship with another type of coin, recursively call dfs\n  if (e[u]!= 0) {\n    dfs(e[u], a[u]);\n    // update the amount of cents remaining\n    t -= a[u];\n    // if the amount of cents remaining is negative, return\n    if (t < 0) {\n      return;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int n, q; // number of types of coins and number of pairs of integers\n  int u, v; // types of coins in a pair\n  scanf(\"%d%d%d\", &n, &q, &t); // read input values\n  // read coin values\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n    scanf(\"%d\", a + i);\n  }\n  // process pairs of integers\n  while (q--) {\n    scanf(\"%d%d\", &u, &v);\n    // establish relationship between types of coins\n    e[u] = v;\n    d[v] = 1;\n  }\n  // perform DFS starting from each type of coin with no relationships\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n && t >= 0; ++i) {\n    if (d[i] == 0) {\n      dfs(i, 0);\n    }\n  }\n  // if there are no valid combinations or the count of valid combinations is less than n, print 0\n  if (t < 0 || cnt < n) {\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  // initialize dp array\n  dp[0] = 1;\n  // iterate through each type of coin and update dp array\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n    for (int j = a[i]; j <= t; ++j) {\n      dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - a[i]]) % MOD;\n    }\n  }\n  // print the total number of valid combinations modulo MOD\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", dp[t]);\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

Instruction i fills a continuous memory segment of length li, starting from cell number ai, (that it cells with numbers ai, ai + 1, ..., ai + li - 1) with values 13.\n\nIn Polycarpus's code, the optimizer's task is to remove the maximum number of instructions from his code in such a way that the remaining instructions set value 13 in all the memory bytes that got this value from the code before the optimization.

Iterate through each memory cell i from 1 to N:\n   a. Find the maximum ending address maxx of the continuous segment of memory cells that have been set to value 13 and end at or before cell i.\n   b.

If cnt is greater than 1, it means that there are multiple instructions that set value 13 in the continuous segment of memory cells from maxx to i. We can remove all instructions except one that sets value 13 in the cell with address maxx. Decrement cnt and mark the instruction that sets value 13 in the cell with address maxx as deleted.\n5.

If the instruction is not deleted, calculate the minimum value of the segment that contains the instruction using the segment tree Tree.

Each point x, y (0 \u2264 x, y \u2264 b) belongs to BSA. To make the path quick and funny, the Beaver constructed a Beaveractor, an effective and comfortable types of transport.\n\nThe campus obeys traffic rules: there are n arrows, parallel to the coordinate axes. The arrows do not intersect and do not touch each other. When the Beaveractor reaches some arrow, it turns in the arrow's direction and moves on until it either reaches the next arrow or gets outside the campus. The Beaveractor covers exactly one unit of space per one unit of time. You can assume that there are no obstacles to the Beaveractor.\n\nThe BSA scientists want to transport the brand new Beaveractor to the \"Academic Tractor\" research institute and send the Smart Beaver to do his postgraduate studies and sharpen pencils. They have q plans, representing the Beaveractor's initial position (xi, yi), the initial motion vector wi and the time ti that have passed after the escape started.\n\nYour task is for each of the q plans to determine the Smart Beaver's position after the given time.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers: the number of traffic rules n and the size of the campus b, 0 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 b. Next n lines contain the rules. Each line of the rules contains four space-separated integers x0, y0, x1, y1 \u2014 the beginning and the end of the arrow. It is guaranteed that all arrows are parallel to the coordinate axes and have no common points. All arrows are located inside the campus, that is, 0 \u2264 x0, y0, x1, y1 \u2264 b holds.\n\nNext line contains integer q \u2014 the number of plans the scientists have, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 105. The i-th plan is represented by two integers, xi, yi are the Beaveractor's coordinates at the initial time, 0 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 b, character wi, that takes value U, D, L, R and sets the initial direction up, down, to the left or to the right correspondingly (the Y axis is directed upwards), and ti \u2014 the time passed after the escape started, 0 \u2264 ti \u2264 1015.\n\n  * to get 30 points you need to solve the problem with constraints n, b \u2264 30 (subproblem D1); \n  * to get 60 points you need to solve the problem with constraints n, b \u2264 1000 (subproblems D1+D2); \n  * to get 100 points you need to solve the problem with constraints n, b \u2264 105 (subproblems D1+D2+D3). \n\nOutput\n\nPrint q lines.

Residents of Tomsk while away the time sitting in warm apartments, inventing a lot of different games. One of such games is 'Colored Jenga'.\n\nThis game requires wooden blocks of three colors: red, green and blue. A tower of n levels is made from them. Each level consists of three wooden blocks. The blocks in each level can be of arbitrary colors, but they are always located close and parallel to each other. An example of such a tower is shown in the figure.\n\n<image>\n\nThe game is played by exactly one person. Every minute a player throws a special dice which has six sides. Two sides of the dice are green, two are blue, one is red and one is black. The dice shows each side equiprobably.\n\nIf the dice shows red, green or blue, the player must take any block of this color out of the tower at this minute so that the tower doesn't fall. If this is not possible, the player waits until the end of the minute, without touching the tower. He also has to wait until the end of the minute without touching the tower if the dice shows the black side. It is not allowed to take blocks from the top level of the tower (whether it is completed or not).\n\nOnce a player got a block out, he must put it on the top of the tower so as to form a new level or finish the upper level consisting of previously placed blocks. The newly constructed levels should have all the same properties as the initial levels. If the upper level is not completed, starting the new level is prohibited.\n\nFor the tower not to fall, in each of the levels except for the top, there should be at least one block. Moreover, if at some of these levels there is exactly one block left and this block is not the middle block, the tower falls.\n\nThe game ends at the moment when there is no block in the tower that you can take out so that the tower doesn't fall.\n\nHere is a wonderful game invented by the residents of the city of Tomsk. I wonder for how many minutes can the game last if the player acts optimally well? If a player acts optimally well, then at any moment he tries to choose the block he takes out so as to minimize the expected number of the game duration.\n\nYour task is to write a program that determines the expected number of the desired amount of minutes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains the only integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 6) \u2014 the number of levels in the tower.\n\nThen n lines follow, describing the levels of the tower from the bottom to the top (the first line is the top of the tower). Each level is described by three characters, the first and the third of them set the border blocks of the level and the second one is the middle block. The character that describes the block has one of the following values 'R' (a red block), 'G' (a green block) and 'B' (a blue block).\n\nOutput\n\nIn the only line of the output print the sought mathematical expectation value. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n6\nRGB\nGRG\nBBB\nGGR\nBRG\nBRB\n\n\nOutput\n\n17.119213696601992",
