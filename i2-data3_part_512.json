Peter learned that and started the following game: he plays the first song of the list of n songs of the group, and you have to find out the name of the song. After you tell the song name, Peter immediately plays the following song in order, and so on.\n\nThe i-th song of AC/PE has its recognizability pi. This means that if the song has not yet been recognized by you, you listen to it for exactly one more second and with probability of pi percent you recognize it and tell it's name. Otherwise you continue listening it. Note that you can only try to guess it only when it is integer number of seconds after the moment the song starts playing.\n\nIn all AC/PE songs the first words of chorus are the same as the title, so when you've heard the first ti seconds of i-th song and its chorus starts, you immediately guess its name for sure.\n\nFor example, in the song Highway To Red the chorus sounds pretty late, but the song has high recognizability. In the song Back In Blue, on the other hand, the words from the title sound close to the beginning of the song, but it's hard to name it before hearing those words. You can name both of these songs during a few more first seconds.\n\nDetermine the expected number songs of you will recognize if the game lasts for exactly T seconds (i. e. you can make the last guess on the second T, after that the game stops).\n\nIf all songs are recognized faster than in T seconds, the game stops after the last song is recognized.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains numbers n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 5000), separated by a space.

He is sure that that there is a large number of transformations that can be expressed through these three.\n\nHe has recently stopped implementing all three transformations for monochrome images. To test this feature, he asked you to write a code that will consecutively perform three actions with a monochrome image: first it will rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise, then it will flip the image horizontally and finally, it will zoom in twice on the image (that is, it will double all the linear sizes).\n\nImplement this feature to help Polycarp test his editor.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers, w and h (1 \u2264 w, h \u2264 100) \u2014 the width and height of an image in pixels.

So this summer day a large queue of n Berland residents lined up in front of the ice cream stall. We know that each of them has a certain amount of berland dollars with them. The residents of Berland are nice people, so each person agrees to swap places with the person right behind him for just 1 dollar. More formally, if person a stands just behind person b, then person a can pay person b 1 dollar, then a and b get swapped. Of course, if person a has zero dollars, he can not swap places with person b.\n\nResidents of Berland are strange people. In particular, they get upset when there is someone with a strictly smaller sum of money in the line in front of them.\n\nCan you help the residents of Berland form such order in the line so that they were all happy?

Initialize an array to store the queries, where each query is represented by its type (1 or 2), and the relevant parameters (x, y, len for type 1, and x, y for type 2).\n3. For each query of type 1, create a node structure to store the query parameters and the query index. The node structure includes the x-coordinate, the left and right boundaries of the triangle, and the query index.\n4. Sort the nodes based on their absolute values of t (which represents the type of query and the direction of the triangle).\n5. Divide the nodes into four groups based on the direction of the triangles (xx, xy, yx, yy) and sort each group separately.\n6. For each group, perform a range update on the segment tree to update the count of robots guarding each point.\n7. For each query of type 2, calculate the number of robots guarding the point by querying the segment tree.\n8.

        "instruction": "After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is a real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than him even using a super computer!\n\nSome days before the contest, the teacher took a very simple-looking exam and all his n students took part in the exam. The teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them. Concatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the other. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to AlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\n\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their strings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\n\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and asks him to correct the students' papers.\n\nShapur is not good at doing such a time-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and take his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has given some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: \n\n  * As I expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained only lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are too much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all the initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. \n  * As latin alphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking characters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters are my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. \n  * The length of all initial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students' answers are less than or equal to 600\n  * My son, not all students are genius as you are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of some characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of AlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. \n  * Those signs which I previously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since many students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a sign. So something like Iran;;-- is the same as --;IRAN\n  * You should indicate for any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing \"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. \n  * I should remind you that none of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. \n  * Finally, do these as soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this. \n\nInput\n\nThe first three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 1000), the number of students.\n\nNext n lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each student write in a different line.

They consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively.\n\nIn the fourth line there is a single integer n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 1000), the number of students.\n\nNext n lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that the answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is from 1 to 600, inclusively.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each student write in a different line.

Otherwise there will be no any exclusivity. So Cicasso will entirely hold the world tour in his native country \u2014 Berland.\n\nCicasso is very devoted to his work and he wants to be distracted as little as possible. Therefore he will visit only four cities. These cities will be different, so no one could think that he has \"favourites\". Of course, to save money, he will chose the shortest paths between these cities. But as you have probably guessed, Cicasso is a weird person. Although he doesn't like to organize exhibitions, he likes to travel around the country and enjoy its scenery. So he wants the total distance which he will travel to be as large as possible. However, the sculptor is bad in planning, so he asks you for help. \n\nThere are n cities and m one-way roads in Berland. You have to choose four different cities, which Cicasso will visit and also determine the order in which he will visit them.

Moreover, it can be several one-way roads between the same pair of cities. \n\nOutput\n\nPrint four integers \u2014 numbers of cities which Cicasso will visit according to optimal choice of the route.

As we know from the previous problem, the nervous system of a zombie consists of n brains and m brain connectors joining some pairs of brains together. It was observed that the intellectual abilities of a zombie depend mainly on the topology of its nervous system. More precisely, we define the distance between two brains u and v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n) as the minimum number of brain connectors used when transmitting a thought between these two brains. The brain latency of a zombie is defined to be the maximum distance between any two of its brains. Researchers conjecture that the brain latency is the crucial parameter which determines how smart a given zombie is. Help them test this conjecture by writing a program to compute brain latencies of nervous systems.\n\nIn this problem you may assume that any nervous system given in the input is valid, i.e., it satisfies conditions (1) and (2) from the easy version.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to n) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.

Thus, by converting the number 475 from decimal to hexadecimal system, he gets 11311 (475 = 1\u00b7162 + 13\u00b7161 + 11\u00b7160). Alexander lived calmly until he tried to convert the number back to the decimal number system.\n\nAlexander remembers that he worked with little numbers so he asks to find the minimum decimal number so that by converting it to the system with the base n he will get the number k.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains the integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 109). The second line contains the integer k (0 \u2264 k < 1060), it is guaranteed that the number k contains no more than 60 symbols.

Preprocess the string: Convert the string into a format that can be used for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This involves initializing arrays A, AA, AAA, B, BB, and BBB with zeros, and then populating them with values based on the characters in the string.\n3. Perform FFT: Apply the FFT algorithm to the preprocessed arrays A, AA, AAA, B, BB, and BBB. This step involves dividing the arrays into smaller chunks, applying the FFT algorithm to each chunk, and then combining the results.\n4. Compute the convolution: Multiply the transformed arrays A, AA, AAA, B, BB, and BBB to compute the convolution of the original string with all possible strings of the same length consisting of 'V' and 'K'.\n5. Find the periods: Iterate through the convolution result and find the periods of the resulting string.

        "instruction": "This is an interactive problem.\n\nJury has hidden a permutation p of integers from 0 to n - 1. You know only the length n. Remind that in permutation all integers are distinct.\n\nLet b be the inverse permutation for p, i.e. pbi = i for all i. The only thing you can do is to ask xor of elements pi and bj, printing two indices i and j (not necessarily distinct). As a result of the query with indices i and j you'll get the value <image>, where <image> denotes the xor operation. You can find the description of xor operation in notes.\n\nNote that some permutations can remain indistinguishable from the hidden one, even if you make all possible n2 queries. You have to compute the number of permutations indistinguishable from the hidden one, and print one of such permutations, making no more than 2n queries.\n\nThe hidden permutation does not depend on your queries.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5000) \u2014 the length of the hidden permutation. You should read this integer first.\n\nOutput\n\nWhen your program is ready to print the answer, print three lines.\n\nIn the first line print \"!\".\n\nIn the second line print single integer answers_cnt \u2014 the number of permutations indistinguishable from the hidden one, including the hidden one. \n\nIn the third line print n integers p0, p1, ..., pn - 1 (0 \u2264 pi < n, all pi should be distinct) \u2014 one of the permutations indistinguishable from the hidden one.\n\nYour program should terminate after printing the answer.\n\nInteraction\n\nTo ask about xor of two elements, print a string \"? i j\", where i and j \u2014 are integers from 0 to n - 1 \u2014 the index of the permutation element and the index of the inverse permutation element you want to know the xor-sum for. After that print a line break and make flush operation.\n\nAfter printing the query your program should read single integer \u2014 the value of <image>.\n\nFor a permutation of length n your program should make no more than 2n queries about xor-sum. Note that printing answer doesn't count as a query. Note that you can't ask more than 2n questions. If you ask more than 2n questions or at least one incorrect question, your solution will get \"Wrong answer\".\n\nIf at some moment your program reads -1 as an answer, it should immediately exit (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will get \"Wrong answer\" in this case, it means that you asked more than 2n questions, or asked an invalid question. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution will get \"Idleness Limit Exceeded\", if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output, including for the final answer .\n\nTo flush you can use (just after printing line break): \n\n  * fflush(stdout) in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * For other languages see the documentation. \n\n\n\nHacking\n\nFor hacking use the following format:\n\nn\n\np0 p1 ... pn - 1\n\nContestant programs will not be able to see this input.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3\n0\n0\n3\n2\n3\n2\n\nOutput\n\n? 0 0\n? 1 1\n? 1 2\n? 0 2\n? 2 1\n? 2 0\n!\n1\n0 1 2\n\nInput\n\n4\n2\n3\n2\n0\n2\n3\n2\n0\n\nOutput\n\n? 0 1\n? 1 2\n? 2 3\n? 3 3\n? 3 2\n? 2 1\n? 1 0\n? 0 0\n!\n2\n3 1 2 0\n\nNote\n\nxor operation, or bitwise exclusive OR, is an operation performed over two integers, in which the i-th digit in binary representation of the result is equal to 1 if and only if exactly one of the two integers has the i-th digit in binary representation equal to 1. For more information, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).\n\nIn the first example p = [0, 1, 2], thus b = [0, 1, 2], the values <image> are correct for the given i, j. There are no other permutations that give the same answers for the given queries.\n\nThe answers for the queries are: \n\n  * <image>, \n  * <image>, \n  * <image>, \n  * <image>, \n  * <image>, \n  * <image>. \n\n\n\nIn the second example p = [3, 1, 2, 0], and b = [3, 1, 2, 0], the values <image> match for all pairs i, j. But there is one more suitable permutation p = [0, 2, 1, 3], b = [0, 2, 1, 3] that matches all n2 possible queries as well. All other permutations do not match even the shown queries.",

Petya wants to evaluate the probability of victory; for some reason, to do that he needs to know the amount of nearly lucky horses' numbers. A nearly lucky number is an integer number that has at least two lucky digits the distance between which does not exceed k. Petya learned from some of his mates from Lviv that lucky digits are digits 4 and 7. The distance between the digits is the absolute difference between their positions in the number of a horse. For example, if k = 2, then numbers 412395497, 404, 4070400000070004007 are nearly lucky and numbers 4, 4123954997, 4007000040070004007 are not.\n\nPetya prepared t intervals [li, ri] and invented number k, common for all of them.

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the number of test cases (t) and the maximum distance between lucky digits (k).\n2. Initialize a 3D dynamic programming table (dp) to store the number of nearly lucky numbers for each prefix of a number, with dimensions (len+1) x (k+1) x 2, where len is the maximum length of a number and the second dimension represents the last position of a lucky digit.\n3. Define a function getdp() to calculate the number of nearly lucky numbers for a given prefix of a number. This function takes four parameters: the current position (l), whether the current position is the last position of a lucky digit (less), the last position of a lucky digit (last), and whether the current number is nearly lucky (ok).\n4. In the getdp() function, iterate over all possible digits (0-9) for the current position. If the current digit is a lucky digit (4 or 7), calculate the number of nearly lucky numbers by recursively calling getdp() for the next position and considering two cases: the current number is nearly lucky or not.\n5. If the current digit is not a lucky digit, calculate the number of nearly lucky numbers by recursively calling getdp() for the next position.\n6. Define a function gao() to calculate the number of nearly lucky numbers for a given number. This function takes a string representation of a number as input and returns the number of nearly lucky numbers.\n7. Define a function test() to check if a given number is nearly lucky. This function takes a string representation of a number as input and returns 1 if the number is nearly lucky and 0 otherwise.\n8. In the run() function, read the test cases and for each test case, read the lower and upper bounds of the range and calculate the number of nearly lucky numbers using the gao() function.

Initialize a 3D dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` with dimensions `(2000 x 3000 x 2)` and fill it with `-1` to store the intermediate results.\n3. Define a function `dfs` to perform a depth-first search on the DP table. This function takes three parameters: the current position `pos`, the current distance `dis`, and a boolean flag `ok` indicating whether a lucky digit has been found.\n4. In the `dfs` function, check if the current position is `-1`, which means we have reached the end of the number. If so, return the value of `ok`.\n5. If the current position is not `-1` and the DP table has a valid result for the current position, distance, and `ok` flag, return the stored result.\n6. Initialize a variable `ans` to store the total count of nearly lucky numbers.\n7. Iterate over the possible digits `i` from `0` to `9` for the current position.\n8. For each digit `i`, update the distance `diss` and the `okk` flag based on whether `i` is a lucky digit (4 or 7) and whether the current distance is within the allowed range `k`.\n9. Recursively call the `dfs` function for the next position, update the `ans` variable, and take the result modulo `mod` to avoid overflow.\n10. Store the result in the DP table if the current position is not the last position.\n11. Define a function `cal` to calculate the count of nearly lucky numbers for a given number `s`.\n12. In the `cal` function, convert the input string `s` to an integer array `num` and call the `dfs` function to calculate the count of nearly lucky numbers.\n13.

Petya wants to evaluate the probability of victory; for some reason, to do that he needs to know the amount of nearly lucky horses' numbers. A nearly lucky number is an integer number that has at least two lucky digits the distance between which does not exceed k. Petya learned from some of his mates from Lviv that lucky digits are digits 4 and 7. The distance between the digits is the absolute difference between their positions in the number of a horse. For example, if k = 2, then numbers 412395497, 404, 4070400000070004007 are nearly lucky and numbers 4, 4123954997, 4007000040070004007 are not.\n\nPetya prepared t intervals [li, ri] and invented number k, common for all of them.

Your subtree consists of the vertices labeled x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_{k_1} in your labeling, Li Chen's subtree consists of the vertices labeled y_1, y_2, \u2026, y_{k_2} in his labeling. The values of x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_{k_1} and y_1, y_2, \u2026, y_{k_2} are known to both of you.\n\n<image> The picture shows two labelings of a possible tree: yours on the left and Li Chen's on the right.

You can ask Andrew at most 5 questions, each of which is in one of the following two forms: \n\n  * A x: Andrew will look at vertex x in your labeling and tell you the number of this vertex in Li Chen's labeling. \n  * B y: Andrew will look at vertex y in Li Chen's labeling and tell you the number of this vertex in your labeling. \n\n\n\nDetermine whether the two subtrees have at least one common vertex after asking some questions. If there is at least one common vertex, determine one of your labels for any of the common vertices.\n\nInteraction\n\nEach test consists of several test cases.\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nFor each testcase, your program should interact in the following format.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nEach of the next n-1 lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1\u2264 a_i, b_i\u2264 n) \u2014 the edges of the tree, indicating an edge between node a_i and b_i according to your labeling of the nodes.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer k_1 (1 \u2264 k_1 \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of nodes in your subtree.\n\nThe next line contains k_1 distinct integers x_1,x_2,\u2026,x_{k_1} (1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the indices of the nodes in your subtree, according to your labeling.

Your program should immediately terminate (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will receive Wrong Answer; it means that you asked more queries than allowed, or asked an invalid query. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, use the following format. Note that you can only hack with one test case.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer t (t=1).\n\nThe second line should contain a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000).\n\nThe third line should contain n integers p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_n (1\u2264 p_i\u2264 n) \u2014 a permutation of 1 to n.

In particular, Li Chen chose label p_i for the node you labeled i.\n\nEach of the next n-1 lines should contain two integers a_i and b_i (1\u2264 a_i, b_i\u2264 n). These edges should form a tree.\n\nThe next line should contain a single integer k_1 (1 \u2264 k_1 \u2264 n).\n\nThe next line should contain k_1 distinct integers x_1,x_2,\u2026,x_{k_1} (1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 n).

On the top, is how you labeled the tree and the subtree you chose, and the bottom is how Li Chen labeled the tree and the subtree he chose: \n\n<image>\n\nIn the first question, you ask Andrew to look at node 1 in your labelling and tell you the label of it in Li Chen's labelling. Andrew responds with 2. At this point, you know that both of your subtrees contain the same node (i.e. node 1 according to your labeling), so you can output \"C 1\" and finish. However, you can also ask Andrew to look at node 2 in Li Chen's labelling and tell you the label of it in your labelling. Andrew responds with 1 (this step was given with the only reason \u2014 to show you how to ask questions).\n\nFor the second sample, there are two test cases. The first looks is the one from the statement: \n\n<image>\n\nWe first ask \"B 2\", and Andrew will tell us 3. In this case, we know 3 is a common vertex, and moreover, any subtree with size 3 that contains node 3 must contain node 1 as well, so we can output either \"C 1\" or \"C 3\" as our answer.\n\nIn the second case in the second sample, the situation looks as follows: \n\n<image>\n\nIn this case, you know that the only subtree of size 3 that doesn't contain node 1 is subtree 4,5,6. You ask Andrew for the label of node 1 in Li Chen's labelling and Andrew says 5. In this case, you know that Li Chen's subtree doesn't contain node 1, so his subtree must be consist of the nodes 4,5,6 (in your labelling), thus the two subtrees have no common nodes.",

        "instruction": "You are playing a strange game with Li Chen. You have a tree with n nodes drawn on a piece of paper. All nodes are unlabeled and distinguishable. Each of you independently labeled the vertices from 1 to n. Neither of you know the other's labelling of the tree.\n\nYou and Li Chen each chose a subtree (i.e., a connected subgraph) in that tree. Your subtree consists of the vertices labeled x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_{k_1} in your labeling, Li Chen's subtree consists of the vertices labeled y_1, y_2, \u2026, y_{k_2} in his labeling. The values of x_1, x_2, \u2026, x_{k_1} and y_1, y_2, \u2026, y_{k_2} are known to both of you.\n\n<image> The picture shows two labelings of a possible tree: yours on the left and Li Chen's on the right. The selected trees are highlighted. There are two common nodes.\n\nYou want to determine whether your subtrees have at least one common vertex. Luckily, your friend Andrew knows both labelings of the tree. You can ask Andrew at most 5 questions, each of which is in one of the following two forms: \n\n  * A x: Andrew will look at vertex x in your labeling and tell you the number of this vertex in Li Chen's labeling. \n  * B y: Andrew will look at vertex y in Li Chen's labeling and tell you the number of this vertex in your labeling. \n\n\n\nDetermine whether the two subtrees have at least one common vertex after asking some questions. If there is at least one common vertex, determine one of your labels for any of the common vertices.\n\nInteraction\n\nEach test consists of several test cases.\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nFor each testcase, your program should interact in the following format.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nEach of the next n-1 lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1\u2264 a_i, b_i\u2264 n) \u2014 the edges of the tree, indicating an edge between node a_i and b_i according to your labeling of the nodes.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer k_1 (1 \u2264 k_1 \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of nodes in your subtree.\n\nThe next line contains k_1 distinct integers x_1,x_2,\u2026,x_{k_1} (1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the indices of the nodes in your subtree, according to your labeling. It is guaranteed that these vertices form a subtree.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer k_2 (1 \u2264 k_2 \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of nodes in Li Chen's subtree.\n\nThe next line contains k_2 distinct integers y_1, y_2, \u2026, y_{k_2} (1 \u2264 y_i \u2264 n) \u2014 the indices (according to Li Chen's labeling) of the nodes in Li Chen's subtree. It is guaranteed that these vertices form a subtree according to Li Chen's labelling of the tree's nodes.\n\nTest cases will be provided one by one, so you must complete interacting with the previous test (i.e. by printing out a common node or -1 if there is not such node) to start receiving the next one.\n\nYou can ask the Andrew two different types of questions. \n\n  * You can print \"A x\" (1 \u2264 x \u2264 n). Andrew will look at vertex x in your labeling and respond to you with the number of this vertex in Li Chen's labeling. \n  * You can print \"B y\" (1 \u2264 y \u2264 n). Andrew will look at vertex y in Li Chen's labeling and respond to you with the number of this vertex in your labeling. \n\n\n\nYou may only ask at most 5 questions per tree.\n\nWhen you are ready to answer, print \"C s\", where s is your label of a vertex that is common to both subtrees, or -1, if no such vertex exists. Printing the answer does not count as a question. Remember to flush your answer to start receiving the next test case. \n\nAfter printing a question do not forget to print end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * see documentation for other languages. \n\n\n\nIf the judge responds with -1, it means that you asked more queries than allowed, or asked an invalid query. Your program should immediately terminate (for example, by calling exit(0)). You will receive Wrong Answer; it means that you asked more queries than allowed, or asked an invalid query. If you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, use the following format. Note that you can only hack with one test case.\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer t (t=1).\n\nThe second line should contain a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000).\n\nThe third line should contain n integers p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_n (1\u2264 p_i\u2264 n) \u2014 a permutation of 1 to n. This encodes the labels that Li Chen chose for his tree. In particular, Li Chen chose label p_i for the node you labeled i.\n\nEach of the next n-1 lines should contain two integers a_i and b_i (1\u2264 a_i, b_i\u2264 n). These edges should form a tree.\n\nThe next line should contain a single integer k_1 (1 \u2264 k_1 \u2264 n).\n\nThe next line should contain k_1 distinct integers x_1,x_2,\u2026,x_{k_1} (1 \u2264 x_i \u2264 n). These vertices should form a subtree.\n\nThe next line should contain a single integer k_2 (1 \u2264 k_2 \u2264 n).\n\nThe next line should contain k_2 distinct integers y_1, y_2, \u2026, y_{k_2} (1 \u2264 y_i \u2264 n). These vertices should form a subtree in Li Chen's tree according to the permutation above.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n1\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\nA 1\nB 2\nC 1\n\n\nInput\n\n2\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n4 5\n4 6\n4\n1 3 4 5\n3\n3 5 2\n3\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n4 5\n4 6\n3\n1 2 3\n3\n4 1 6\n5\n\n\nOutput\n\nB 2\nC 1\nA 1\nC -1\n\nNote\n\nFor the first sample, Li Chen's hidden permutation is [2, 3, 1], and for the second, his hidden permutation is [5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 6] for both cases.\n\nIn the first sample, there is a tree with three nodes in a line. On the top, is how you labeled the tree and the subtree you chose, and the bottom is how Li Chen labeled the tree and the subtree he chose: \n\n<image>\n\nIn the first question, you ask Andrew to look at node 1 in your labelling and tell you the label of it in Li Chen's labelling. Andrew responds with 2. At this point, you know that both of your subtrees contain the same node (i.e. node 1 according to your labeling), so you can output \"C 1\" and finish. However, you can also ask Andrew to look at node 2 in Li Chen's labelling and tell you the label of it in your labelling. Andrew responds with 1 (this step was given with the only reason \u2014 to show you how to ask questions).\n\nFor the second sample, there are two test cases. The first looks is the one from the statement: \n\n<image>\n\nWe first ask \"B 2\", and Andrew will tell us 3. In this case, we know 3 is a common vertex, and moreover, any subtree with size 3 that contains node 3 must contain node 1 as well, so we can output either \"C 1\" or \"C 3\" as our answer.\n\nIn the second case in the second sample, the situation looks as follows: \n\n<image>\n\nIn this case, you know that the only subtree of size 3 that doesn't contain node 1 is subtree 4,5,6. You ask Andrew for the label of node 1 in Li Chen's labelling and Andrew says 5.

Iterate through each event in the input:\n   - If the event is a join operation (+ t d), update the SegTree by adding the duration d to the node corresponding to the time t - 1. This represents the knight joining the queue at time t with a visit duration of d.\n   - If the event is a cancel operation (- i), update the SegTree by subtracting the duration d from the node corresponding to the time t - 1, where t and d are obtained from the join operation with index i - 1. This represents the knight canceling their visit.\n   - If the event is a query operation (? t), use the SegTree to calculate the delay for the princess to see her father if she enters the queue at time t. The delay is calculated by finding the maximum of the sum of durations of knights who have not yet visited and the maximum duration of knights who have visited before time t.\n4. For each query, print the calculated delay.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n#pragma comment(linker, \"/STACK:16777216\")\nconst int MAX_TIME = 1000000;\n\n// Define a TreeNode structure to represent a node in the SegTree\nstruct TreeNode {\n  long long sum, maximum; // sum of durations and maximum duration\n  TreeNode() : sum(0), maximum(0){}; // default constructor\n  TreeNode(long long sum, long long maximum) { // constructor\n    this->sum = sum;\n    this->maximum = maximum;\n  }\n  // update method to combine two nodes\n  TreeNode update(const TreeNode& left, const TreeNode& right) {\n    return TreeNode(right.sum + left.sum, // sum of durations\n                    std::max(right.maximum, left.maximum + right.sum)); // maximum duration\n  }\n};\n\n// Define a SegTree class to manage the queue\nstruct SegTree {\n  // get left child index\n  inline int get_left_child(int index) { return 2 * index + 1; }\n  // get right child index\n  inline int get_right_child(int index) { return 2 * index + 2; }\n  // get middle index\n  inline int get_middle(int left, int right) { return (left + right) / 2; }\n  // update statistics for a node\n  void update_statistics(int index) {\n    _array[index] = _array[index].update(_array[get_left_child(index)],\n                                         _array[get_right_child(index)]);\n  }\n  // build the SegTree\n  void build(int index, int left_time, int right_time) {\n    if (left_time == right_time) { // base case: single node\n      _array[index] = TreeNode(0, left_time); // initialize node with sum 0 and maximum left_time\n      return;\n    }\n    int middle = get_middle(left_time, right_time); // get middle index\n    build(get_left_child(index), left_time, middle); // build left subtree\n    build(get_right_child(index), middle + 1, right_time); // build right subtree\n    update_statistics(index); // update statistics for current node\n  }\n  // update the SegTree\n  void update(int index, int left_bound, int right_bound, int modification_index, int delta) {\n    if (left_bound == right_bound) { // base case: single node\n      _array[index].sum += delta; // update sum\n      _array[index].maximum += delta; // update maximum\n      return;\n    }\n    int middle = get_middle(left_bound, right_bound); // get middle index\n    if (modification_index <= middle) { // update left subtree\n      update(get_left_child(index), left_bound, middle, modification_index, delta);\n    } else { // update right subtree\n      update(get_right_child(index), middle + 1, right_bound, modification_index, delta);\n    }\n    update_statistics(index); // update statistics for current node\n  }\n  // get delay for a query\n  long long get_delay(int index, int left, int right, int T, long long current_result) {\n    if (right <= T) { // base case: query time is within current node's range\n      return std::max(_array[index].maximum, // maximum duration\n                      _array[index].sum + current_result); // sum of durations\n    }\n    int middle = get_middle(left, right); // get middle index\n    current_result = std::max(current_result, // update current result\n                              get_delay(get_left_child(index), left, middle, T, current_result)); // recurse left subtree\n    if (middle < T) { // recurse right subtree if necessary\n      current_result = std::max(current_result, get_delay(get_right_child(index), middle + 1, right, T, current_result));\n    }\n    return current_result; // return final result\n  }\n};\n\nint main() {\n  int q; // number of events\n  scanf(\"%d\", &q);\n  char operation[2]; // operation type\n  std::vector<int> times(q, 0); // times of knights' visits\n  std::vector<int> durations(q, 0); // durations of knights' visits\n  SegTree tree; // SegTree object\n  tree.build(0, 0, MAX_TIME); // build SegTree\n  for (size_t i = 0; i < q; ++i) { // iterate through events\n    scanf(\"%s\", &operation);\n    if (operation[0] == '+') { // join operation\n      int t, d; // time and duration of visit\n      scanf(\"%d %d\", &t, &d);\n      times[i] = t - 1; // store time\n      durations[i] = d; // store duration\n      tree.update(0, 0, MAX_TIME, t - 1, d); // update SegTree\n    }\n    if (operation[0] == '-') { // cancel operation\n      int join_idx; // index of join operation to cancel\n      scanf(\"%d\", &join_idx);\n      tree.update(0, 0, MAX_TIME, times[join_idx - 1], -durations[join_idx - 1]); // update SegTree\n    }\n    if (operation[0] == '?') { // query operation\n      int T; // query time\n      scanf(\"%d\", &T);\n      long long delay = tree.get_delay(0, 0, MAX_TIME, T - 1, 0) - (T - 1); // calculate delay\n      if (delay < 0) { // handle negative delay\n        delay = 0;\n      }\n      std::cout << delay << std::endl; // print delay\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
