Create an adjacency list `graph` to represent the dominoes, where each index `i` represents a domino with `i` spots on one end. The list `graph[i][j]` stores the indices of dominoes that can be connected to `i` with `j` spots on the other end.\n3. Initialize an array `deg` to keep track of the degree of each domino (i.e., the number of dominoes it can be connected to).\n4. Read the dominoes from the input and update the `graph` and `deg` accordingly.\n5. Identify the starting domino `start` by finding a domino with an odd degree or a domino with a degree greater than 0 if no domino has an odd degree. If more than two dominoes have an odd degree, it's impossible to arrange the dominoes, so set `bad` to `true`.\n6. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) from the starting domino `start` to find a valid arrangement of dominoes. During the DFS, keep track of the dominoes in the current path `T` and the dominoes that have been visited but not yet added to the solution `S`.\n7. If the DFS completes successfully and the number of dominoes in `S` is equal to `n`, it means a valid arrangement has been found. Otherwise, set `bad` to `true`.\n8. If `bad` is still `false`, print the arrangement of dominoes by iterating through `S` and printing the index of each domino and whether it needs to be rotated (`+` or `-`).\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Adjacency list to represent dominoes\nvector<int> graph[10][10];\n\n// Degree of each domino\nint deg[10];\n\n// Edges between dominoes\nvector<pair<int, int> > edge;\n\n// Current path during DFS\nvector<int> T, S;\n\n// Perform DFS from a given node\nvoid dfs(int node) {\n  int i = 0;\n  for (i = 0; i <= 6; i++) {\n    // If there's an edge from node to i, explore it\n    if (graph[node][i].size() > 0) {\n      int e = graph[node][i].back();\n      graph[node][i].pop_back();\n      graph[i][node].erase(find(graph[i][node].begin(), graph[i][node].end(), -e));\n      T.push_back(e);\n      dfs(i);\n      // Backtrack and add visited dominoes to the solution\n      while (!T.empty()) {\n        S.push_back(T.back());\n        T.pop_back();\n        if (S.back() == e) break;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  int n, u, v;\n  cin >> n;\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    cin >> u >> v;\n    // Add edges to the graph and update degrees\n    graph[u][v].push_back(i);\n    graph[v][u].push_back(-i);\n    deg[u]++;\n    deg[v]++;\n    edge.push_back(make_pair(u, v));\n  }\n\n  // Find the starting domino\n  int start = -1;\n  int odd = 0;\n  bool bad = false;\n  for (int i = 0; i <= 6; i++) {\n    if (deg[i] % 2 == 1) {\n      start = i;\n      odd++;\n    } else if (start == -1 && deg[i] > 0) {\n      start = i;\n    }\n  }\n  if (odd > 2) bad = true;\n\n  // Perform DFS to find a valid arrangement\n  dfs(start);\n  if (S.size()!= n) bad = true;\n\n  // Print the arrangement if it exists\n  if (bad) {\n    cout << \"No solution\\n\";\n  } else {\n    while (!S.empty()) {\n      int cur = S.back();\n      S.pop_back();\n      // Print the index of the domino and whether it needs to be rotated\n      cout << abs(cur) << \" \" << ((cur < 0)?

This time he has been given a homework about the unusual square of a square matrix.\n\nThe dot product of two integer number vectors x and y of size n is the sum of the products of the corresponding components of the vectors. The unusual square of an n \u00d7 n square matrix A is defined as the sum of n dot products. The i-th of them is the dot product of the i-th row vector and the i-th column vector in the matrix A.\n\nFortunately for Chris, he has to work only in GF(2)! This means that all operations (addition, multiplication) are calculated modulo 2. In fact, the matrix A is binary: each element of A is either 0 or 1. For example, consider the following matrix A:\n\n<image>\n\nThe unusual square of A is equal to (1\u00b71 + 1\u00b70 + 1\u00b71) + (0\u00b71 + 1\u00b71 + 1\u00b70) + (1\u00b71 + 0\u00b71 + 0\u00b70) = 0 + 1 + 1 = 0.\n\nHowever, there is much more to the homework. Chris has to process q queries; each query can be one of the following: \n\n  1. given a row index i, flip all the values in the i-th row in A; \n  2. given a column index i, flip all the values in the i-th column in A; \n  3. find the unusual square of A. \n\n\n\nTo flip a bit value w means to change it to 1 - w, i.e., 1 changes to 0 and 0 changes to 1.\n\nGiven the initial matrix A, output the answers for each query of the third type!

        "instruction": "A new innovative ticketing systems for public transport is introduced in Bytesburg. Now there is a single travel card for all transport. To make a trip a passenger scan his card and then he is charged according to the fare.\n\nThe fare is constructed in the following manner. There are three types of tickets: \n\n  1. a ticket for one trip costs 20 byteland rubles, \n  2. a ticket for 90 minutes costs 50 byteland rubles, \n  3. a ticket for one day (1440 minutes) costs 120 byteland rubles. \n\n\n\nNote that a ticket for x minutes activated at time t can be used for trips started in time range from t to t + x - 1, inclusive. Assume that all trips take exactly one minute.\n\nTo simplify the choice for the passenger, the system automatically chooses the optimal tickets. After each trip starts, the system analyses all the previous trips and the current trip and chooses a set of tickets for these trips with a minimum total cost. Let the minimum total cost of tickets to cover all trips from the first to the current is a, and the total sum charged before is b. Then the system charges the passenger the sum a - b.\n\nYou have to write a program that, for given trips made by a passenger, calculates the sum the passenger is charged after each trip.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of trips made by passenger.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains the time of trip ti (0 \u2264 ti \u2264 109), measured in minutes from the time of starting the system. All ti are different, given in ascending order, i. e. ti + 1 > ti holds for all 1 \u2264 i < n.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput n integers.

This ticket costs 50 rubles, and the passenger had already paid 40 rubles, so it is necessary to charge 10 rubles only.",

        "instruction": "A new innovative ticketing systems for public transport is introduced in Bytesburg. Now there is a single travel card for all transport. To make a trip a passenger scan his card and then he is charged according to the fare.\n\nThe fare is constructed in the following manner. There are three types of tickets: \n\n  1. a ticket for one trip costs 20 byteland rubles, \n  2. a ticket for 90 minutes costs 50 byteland rubles, \n  3. a ticket for one day (1440 minutes) costs 120 byteland rubles. \n\n\n\nNote that a ticket for x minutes activated at time t can be used for trips started in time range from t to t + x - 1, inclusive. Assume that all trips take exactly one minute.\n\nTo simplify the choice for the passenger, the system automatically chooses the optimal tickets. After each trip starts, the system analyses all the previous trips and the current trip and chooses a set of tickets for these trips with a minimum total cost. Let the minimum total cost of tickets to cover all trips from the first to the current is a, and the total sum charged before is b.

        "instruction": "A new bus route is opened in the city <image>. The route is a closed polygon line in the place, with all segments parallel to one of the axes. m buses will operate on the route. All buses move in a loop along the route in the same direction with equal constant velocities (stopping times are negligible in this problem).\n\nBuses start their movement in the first vertex of the route with equal interval. Suppose that T is the total time for a single bus to travel the whole loop of the route. Then, the bus 1 starts moving at time 0, the bus 2 starts at time T / m, the bus 3 starts at time 2T / m, and so on; finally, the bus m starts moving at time (m - 1)T / m. Thus, all intervals between pairs of consecutive buses (including the interval between the last and the first bus) are equal.\n\nBuses can communicate with each other via wireless transmitters of equal power. If the transmitters have power D, then only buses within distance D of each other can communicate.\n\nThe buses are also equipped with a distributed system of schedule tracking. For all buses to stick to the schedule, the system has to synchronize the necessary data between all buses from time to time. At the moment of synchronization, the bus 1 communicates with the bus 2, the bus 2 \u2014 with bus 3, and so on; also, the bus m communicates with the bus 1.\n\nAs a research employee, you are tasked with finding the smallest value of D such that it is possible to find a time moment to perform synchronization once all buses have started moving. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of vertices of the polygonal line, and the number of buses respectively.\n\nNext n lines describe the vertices of the route in the traversing order. Each of these lines contains two integers xi, yi ( - 1000 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 1000) \u2014 coordinates of respective vertex.\n\nIt is guaranteed that each leg of the route (including the leg between the last and the first vertex) is paralles to one of the coordinate axes. Moreover, no two subsequent vertices of the route coincide. The route is allowed to have self-intersections, and travel along the same segment multiple times.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one real number \u2014 the answer to the problem.

What is special about this very cashier is that it can serve two customers simultaneously. However, if two customers need ai and aj of time to be served, the time needed to work with both of them customers is equal to max(ai, aj). Please note that working with customers is an uninterruptable process, and therefore, if two people simultaneously come to the cashier, it means that they begin to be served simultaneously, and will both finish simultaneously (it is possible that one of them will have to wait).\n\nVasya used in his algorithm an ingenious heuristic \u2014 as long as the queue has more than one person waiting, then some two people of the first three standing in front of the queue are sent simultaneously. If the queue has only one customer number i, then he goes to the cashier, and is served within ai of time. Note that the total number of phases of serving a customer will always be equal to \u2308n / 2\u2309.\n\nVasya thinks that this method will help to cope with the queues we all hate. That's why he asked you to work out a program that will determine the minimum time during which the whole queue will be served using this algorithm.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input file contains a single number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000), which is the number of people in the sequence. The second line contains space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 106). The people are numbered starting from the cashier to the end of the queue.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint on the first line a single number \u2014 the minimum time needed to process all n people. Then on \u2308n / 2\u2309 lines print the order in which customers will be served.

Initialize a 2D array (f) of size (n+1) x (n+1) to store the minimum time required to serve the customers from index i to j.\n4. Fill the f array using dynamic programming. For each subarray from index i to j, calculate the minimum time required to serve the customers by considering three possible scenarios:\n   - Serve the first two customers simultaneously and then the next customer.\n   - Serve the first and third customers simultaneously and then the second customer.\n   - Serve the second and third customers simultaneously and then the first customer.\n5. Choose the scenario that results in the minimum time and update the f array accordingly.\n6. Once the f array is filled, find the minimum time required to serve all customers by looking at the value of f[1][2].\n7. Print the minimum time required to serve all customers.\n8.

        "instruction": "Vasya has recently developed a new algorithm to optimize the reception of customer flow and he considered the following problem.\n\nLet the queue to the cashier contain n people, at that each of them is characterized by a positive integer ai \u2014 that is the time needed to work with this customer. What is special about this very cashier is that it can serve two customers simultaneously. However, if two customers need ai and aj of time to be served, the time needed to work with both of them customers is equal to max(ai, aj). Please note that working with customers is an uninterruptable process, and therefore, if two people simultaneously come to the cashier, it means that they begin to be served simultaneously, and will both finish simultaneously (it is possible that one of them will have to wait).\n\nVasya used in his algorithm an ingenious heuristic \u2014 as long as the queue has more than one person waiting, then some two people of the first three standing in front of the queue are sent simultaneously. If the queue has only one customer number i, then he goes to the cashier, and is served within ai of time. Note that the total number of phases of serving a customer will always be equal to \u2308n / 2\u2309.\n\nVasya thinks that this method will help to cope with the queues we all hate. That's why he asked you to work out a program that will determine the minimum time during which the whole queue will be served using this algorithm.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input file contains a single number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000), which is the number of people in the sequence. The second line contains space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 106). The people are numbered starting from the cashier to the end of the queue.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint on the first line a single number \u2014 the minimum time needed to process all n people. Then on \u2308n / 2\u2309 lines print the order in which customers will be served. Each line (probably, except for the last one) must contain two numbers separated by a space \u2014 the numbers of customers who will be served at the current stage of processing. If n is odd, then the last line must contain a single number \u2014 the number of the last served customer in the queue. The customers are numbered starting from 1.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4\n1 2 3 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n6\n1 2\n3 4\n\n\nInput\n\n5\n2 4 3 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n8\n1 3\n2 5\n4",
