Iterate through the array and for each index, update the segment tree by adding or removing segments from the set based on the current index.\n7.

In one snap, you can remove any two points a and b that have not been removed yet and form a perfectly balanced pair. A pair of points a and b is perfectly balanced if no other point c (that has not been removed yet) lies within the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of points a and b.\n\nFormally, point c lies within the axis-aligned minimum bounding box of points a and b if and only if min(x_a, x_b) \u2264 x_c \u2264 max(x_a, x_b), min(y_a, y_b) \u2264 y_c \u2264 max(y_a, y_b), and min(z_a, z_b) \u2264 z_c \u2264 max(z_a, z_b).

The cost of a path (not necessarily simple) in this graph is defined as the [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of weights of all edges in that path with each edge being counted as many times as the path passes through it.\n\nBut the trips with cost 0 aren't exciting.\n\nYou may choose any subset of edges incident to the vertex 1 and remove them. How many are there such subsets, that, when removed, there is not any nontrivial cycle with the cost equal to 0 which passes through the vertex 1 in the resulting graph? A cycle is called nontrivial if it passes through some edge odd number of times. As the answer can be very big, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n,m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of vertexes and edges in the graph.

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input and initialize the graph with the given number of vertices and edges.\n2. Build a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of connected components in the graph.\n3. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) from vertex 0 to calculate the cost and connected component of each vertex.\n4. Identify the parent of each vertex and store it in the `parent` array.\n5. Create a bitset `flag` to mark vertices that are directly connected to vertex 0.\n6. Create a bitset `dead` to mark vertices that are part of a cycle with cost 0.\n7. Create an array `pa` to store the parent and cost of each vertex.\n8. Iterate through the edges of vertex 0 and update the `pa` array based on the cost and parent of each connected vertex.\n9. Iterate through the edges of each vertex and update the `stor` array based on the cost and connected component of each connected vertex.\n10. Simplify the `stor` array by removing redundant bits and sorting it in ascending order.\n11. If the `stor` array is empty or its first element is 0, mark the vertex as dead.\n12. Build a combinatorial table `comb` to store the result of combining two basis vectors.\n13. Initialize the `ways` array with 1 and iterate through the edges of vertex 0.\n14. For each edge, update the `ways` array based on the cost and connected component of the connected vertex.\n15. If the connected vertex is dead, skip it.\n16. If the connected vertex has a parent, update the `ways` array based on the cost and connected component of the parent vertex.\n17.

In other words, check whether each grain can have such a mass that the i-th grain weighs some integer number x_i (a - b \u2264 x_i \u2264 a + b), and in total they weigh from c - d to c + d, inclusive (c - d \u2264 \u2211_{i=1}^{n}{x_i} \u2264 c + d).\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. \n\nThe next t lines contain descriptions of the test cases, each line contains 5 integers: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of grains that Nastya counted and a, b, c, d (0 \u2264 b < a \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 d < c \u2264 1000) \u2014 numbers that determine the possible weight of one grain of rice (from a - b to a + b) and the possible total weight of the package (from c - d to c + d).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case given in the input print \"Yes\", if the information about the weights is not inconsistent, and print \"No\" if n grains with masses from a - b to a + b cannot make a package with a total mass from c - d to c + d.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n7 20 3 101 18\n11 11 10 234 2\n8 9 7 250 122\n19 41 21 321 10\n3 10 8 6 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case of the example, we can assume that each grain weighs 17 grams, and a pack 119 grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole pack.\n\nIn the third test case of the example, we can assume that each grain weighs 16 grams, and a pack 128 grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole pack.\n\nIn the fifth test case of the example, we can be assumed that 3 grains of rice weigh 2, 2, and 3 grams, and a pack is 7 grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole pack.\n\nIn the second and fourth test cases of the example, we can prove that it is impossible to determine the correct weight of all grains of rice and the weight of the pack so that the weight of the pack is equal to the total weight of all collected grains.",

In day i, he will harvest all bushes that have fruits on the subtree of vertex X_i. For each day, determine the sum of distances from every harvested bush to X_i, and the number of harvested bush that day. Harvesting a bush means collecting all fruits on the bush.\n\nFor example, if Mr. Chanek harvests all fruits on subtree of vertex X, and harvested bushes [Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_M], the sum of distances is \u2211_{i = 1}^M distance(X, Y_i)\n\ndistance(U, V) in a tree is defined to be the number of edges on the simple path from U to V.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and Q (1 \u2264 N,\\ Q,\u2264 5 \u22c5 10^4), which denotes the number of vertices and the number of days Mr. Chanek visits the orchard.\n\nThe second line contains N integers A_i (1 \u2264 A_i \u2264 5 \u22c5 10^4), which denotes the fruits growth speed on the bush at vertex i, for (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N).\n\nThe third line contains N-1 integers P_i (1 \u2264 P_i \u2264 N, P_i \u2260 i), which denotes the parent of vertex i in the tree, for (2 \u2264 i \u2264 N).

More formally, if the position of the k-th zero was x, then after Polycarp guesses this position, the x-th element of the array will be replaced from 0 to 1.\n\nHelp Polycarp win the game.\n\nInteraction\n\nFirst, your program must read two integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 min(n, 10^4)).\n\nThen t lines follow, each of which contains one integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n).

For each query, calculate the prefix sum of the array from 1 to k using the ask function, which outputs the query and reads the response from the input.\n4. If the prefix sum is -1, it means the query is invalid, and the program should exit.\n5. Use the query function to find the k-th zero in the array. This function uses a binary search approach to find the k-th zero by maintaining a running prefix sum and adjusting the search range accordingly.\n6. If the query function returns false, it means the k-th zero is not found, and the program should exit.\n7. If the query function returns true, it means the k-th zero is found, and the program should output the position of the k-th zero.\n8.

The problem authors were reluctant to waste time on thinking of a name for some string so they called it good. A string is good if it doesn't have palindrome substrings longer than or equal to d. \n\nYou are given string s, consisting only of lowercase English letters. Find a good string t with length |s|, consisting of lowercase English letters, which is lexicographically larger than s. Of all such strings string t must be lexicographically minimum.\n\nWe will call a non-empty string s[a ... b] = sasa + 1... sb (1 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 |s|) a substring of string s = s1s2... s|s|.\n\nA non-empty string s = s1s2... sn is called a palindrome if for all i from 1 to n the following fulfills: si = sn - i + 1. In other words, palindrome read the same in both directions.\n\nString x = x1x2... x|x| is lexicographically larger than string y = y1y2... y|y|, if either |x| > |y| and x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , x|y| = y|y|, or there exists such number r (r < |x|, r < |y|), that x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ... , xr = yr and xr + 1 > yr + 1.

Initialize an empty list of lists, `res`, to store the segments assigned to each child. Each inner list will represent the segments assigned to a child.\n3. Read the k desired segment numbers from the input and store them in the `res` list, ensuring that each child's list contains only their desired segment number.\n4. Create a set, `used`, to keep track of the segment numbers that have been assigned to a child.\n5. Iterate through the range of segment numbers from 1 to n*k (inclusive). For each segment number, check if it has already been assigned to a child by verifying its presence in the `used` set.\n6. If the segment number has not been assigned, find the child who has not yet received n segments by iterating through the `res` list. When such a child is found, append the current segment number to their list.\n7.

        "instruction": "Emuskald was hired to design an artificial waterfall according to the latest trends in landscape architecture. A modern artificial waterfall consists of multiple horizontal panels affixed to a wide flat wall. The water flows down the top of the wall from panel to panel until it reaches the bottom of the wall.\n\nThe wall has height t and has n panels on the wall. Each panel is a horizontal segment at height hi which begins at li and ends at ri. The i-th panel connects the points (li, hi) and (ri, hi) of the plane. The top of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points ( - 109, t) and (109, t). Similarly, the bottom of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points ( - 109, 0) and (109, 0). No two panels share a common point.\n\nEmuskald knows that for the waterfall to be aesthetically pleasing, it can flow from panel i to panel j (<image>) only if the following conditions hold: \n\n  1. max(li, lj) < min(ri, rj) (horizontal projections of the panels overlap); \n  2. hj < hi (panel j is below panel i); \n  3. there is no such panel k (hj < hk < hi) that the first two conditions hold for the pairs (i, k) and (k, j). \n\n\n\nThen the flow for <image> is equal to min(ri, rj) - max(li, lj), the length of their horizontal projection overlap.\n\nEmuskald has decided that in his waterfall the water will flow in a single path from top to bottom. If water flows to a panel (except the bottom of the wall), the water will fall further to exactly one lower panel. The total amount of water flow in the waterfall is then defined as the minimum horizontal projection overlap between two consecutive panels in the path of the waterfall. Formally: \n\n  1. the waterfall consists of a single path of panels <image>; \n  2. the flow of the waterfall is the minimum flow in the path <image>. \n\n\n\nTo make a truly great waterfall Emuskald must maximize this water flow, but there are too many panels and he is having a hard time planning his creation. Below is an example of a waterfall Emuskald wants:\n\n<image>\n\nHelp Emuskald maintain his reputation and find the value of the maximum possible water flow.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 2 \u2264 t \u2264 109), the number of the panels excluding the top and the bottom panels, and the height of the wall. Each of the n following lines contain three space-separated integers hi, li and ri (0 < hi < t,  - 109 \u2264 li < ri \u2264 109), the height, left and right ends of the i-th panel segment.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two segments share a common point.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible amount of water flow in the desired waterfall.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n5 6\n4 1 6\n3 2 7\n5 9 11\n3 10 15\n1 13 16\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n6 5\n4 2 8\n3 1 2\n2 2 3\n2 6 12\n1 0 7\n1 8 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nThe first test case corresponds to the picture.",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input values for the number of panels (excluding the top and bottom panels) and the height of the wall.\n2. Initialize the line structure for each panel and the part structure for each segment.\n3. Read the height, left end, and right end of each panel and store them in the line structure.\n4. Add the top and bottom panels to the line structure.\n5. Sort the panels based on their heights and then their right ends.\n6. Create a set to store the segments that cover the current panel.\n7. Iterate through the sorted panels and for each panel, find the segments that cover it.\n8. For each segment that covers the current panel, check if it can flow to the current panel.\n9. If a segment can flow to the current panel, add its id to the current panel's pointer set.\n10. Create a set to store the segments that do not cover the current panel.\n11. Iterate through the segments that do not cover the current panel and add them to the set.\n12. Remove the segments that cover the current panel from the set of all segments.\n13. Add the current panel to the set of all segments.\n14. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to find the maximum possible water flow.\n15. The DFS function takes a panel as input and returns the maximum possible water flow that can be achieved by flowing from the top panel to the current panel.\n16. If the current panel is the top panel, return a large value (2 * oo) to indicate that the maximum possible water flow is infinite.\n17. If the current panel has no outgoing edges, return a small value (-2 * oo) to indicate that the maximum possible water flow is zero.\n18. Iterate through the panels that the current panel can flow to and for each panel, calculate the overlap between the current panel and the panel.\n19. Recursively call the DFS function on each panel that the current panel can flow to and update the maximum possible water flow.\n20.
