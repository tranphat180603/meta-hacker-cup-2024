        "instruction": "Gildong has a square board consisting of n rows and n columns of square cells, each consisting of a single digit (from 0 to 9). The cell at the j-th column of the i-th row can be represented as (i, j), and the length of the side of each cell is 1. Gildong likes big things, so for each digit d, he wants to find a triangle such that:\n\n  * Each vertex of the triangle is in the center of a cell. \n  * The digit of every vertex of the triangle is d. \n  * At least one side of the triangle is parallel to one of the sides of the board. You may assume that a side of length 0 is parallel to both sides of the board. \n  * The area of the triangle is maximized. \n\n\n\nOf course, he can't just be happy with finding these triangles as is. Therefore, for each digit d, he's going to change the digit of exactly one cell of the board to d, then find such a triangle. He changes it back to its original digit after he is done with each digit. Find the maximum area of the triangle he can make for each digit.\n\nNote that he can put multiple vertices of the triangle on the same cell, and the triangle can be a [degenerate triangle](https://cutt.ly/NhbjZ2l); i.e. the area of the triangle can be 0. Also, note that he is allowed to change the digit of a cell from d to d.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the board.\n\nThe next n lines of each test case each contain a string of n digits without spaces. The j-th digit of the i-th line is the digit of the cell at (i, j). Each digit is one of the characters from 0 to 9.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 in all test cases doesn't exceed 4 \u22c5 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one line with 10 integers. The i-th integer is the maximum area of triangle Gildong can make when d = i-1, multiplied by 2.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n3\n000\n122\n001\n2\n57\n75\n4\n0123\n4012\n3401\n2340\n1\n9\n8\n42987101\n98289412\n38949562\n87599023\n92834718\n83917348\n19823743\n38947912\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0\n9 6 9 9 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n18 49 49 49 49 15 0 30 42 42\n\nNote\n\nIn the first case, for d=0, no matter which cell he chooses to use, the triangle with vertices at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (3, 1) is the biggest triangle with area of \\cfrac{2 \u22c5 2}{2} = 2. Since we should print it multiplied by 2, the answer for d=0 is 4.\n\nFor d=1, Gildong can change the digit of the cell at (1, 3) into 1, making a triangle with vertices on all three 1's that has an area of 2.\n\nFor d=2, Gildong can change the digit of one of the following six cells into 2 to make a triangle with an area of \\cfrac{1}{2}: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 3).\n\nFor the remaining digits (from 3 to 9), the cell Gildong chooses to change will be the only cell that contains that digit. Therefore the triangle will always be a degenerate triangle with an area of 0.\n\nIn the third case, for d=4, note that the triangle will be bigger than the answer if Gildong changes the digit of the cell at (1, 4) and use it along with the cells at (2, 1) and (4, 3), but this is invalid because it violates the condition that at least one side of the triangle must be parallel to one of the sides of the board.",

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input values: The first input line contains a single integer n, which represents the size of the magic square. The next line contains n^2 integers ai, which are the elements of the magic square.\n2. Calculate the sum s: The sum s is calculated by adding all the elements in the input array A.\n3. Initialize the magic square: The magic square is represented as a 2D array T of size n x n. All elements in the array are initialized to 0.\n4. Initialize the frequency arrays: The frequency arrays F, C, and D are used to keep track of the sum of elements in each row, column, and diagonal of the magic square. They are initialized to 0.\n5. Initialize the used array: The used array is used to keep track of the elements that have been placed in the magic square. It is initialized to false for all elements.\n6. Initialize the WF and WC arrays: The WF and WC arrays are used to determine the next row and column for a given position in the magic square. They are initialized based on the size of the magic square.\n7. Perform a brute-force search: The brute-force search function bf is called to find a solution for the magic square. It takes three parameters: the current row f, the current column c, and the current position pos.\n8. Base case: If the current row f is equal to n, it means that the magic square is complete. The sum s is printed, and the magic square is printed row by row.\n9. Recursive case: If the current row f is not equal to n, the function tries to place each element in the input array A in the current position (f, c). If an element can be placed, the function updates the frequency arrays and the used array. It then calls itself recursively with the next row and column.\n10. Backtracking: If the function cannot place an element in the current position, it backtracks by removing the element from the used array and updating the frequency arrays.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int MAXN = 25;\nint n, N, A[MAXN], s, T[MAXN][MAXN], F[MAXN], C[MAXN], D[2], FN[MAXN], CN[MAXN],\n    DN[2];\nbool used[MAXN], solved;\nint WF[MAXN], WC[MAXN];\n// WF and WC arrays are used to determine the next row and column for a given position in the magic square\nbool tenta(int i, int x, int y) {\n  // Check if the element at index i can be placed in the current position (x, y)\n  if (used[i]) return false; // If the element is already used, it cannot be placed\n  int fn = FN[x] + 1; // Calculate the frequency of the row x\n  int cn = CN[y] + 1; // Calculate the frequency of the column y\n  int d = (x == y)?

Calculate the target sum `s` for each row, column, and diagonal by dividing `t` by `n`.\n4. Initialize the magic square `ans` with the target sum `s` in the first row.\n5. Use a recursive function `gao` to fill in the magic square. The function takes the current row `i` and column `j` as parameters.\n6. In the `gao` function, check if the current position is at the bottom row. If so, calculate the remaining sum `x` for the bottom row and check if it's valid. If valid, fill in the numbers from the map `num` into the bottom row and check if the magic square is complete.\n7. If the current position is at the last column, calculate the remaining sum `x` for the current row and check if it's valid. If valid, decrement the count of `x` in the map `num`, fill in the number `x` into the next row and column, and recursively call `gao` with the updated parameters.\n8. If the current position is not at the bottom row or last column, iterate through the map `num` in reverse order to find the next number to fill in. If a valid number is found, decrement its count, fill in the number into the next position, and recursively call `gao` with the updated parameters.\n9. If no valid number is found, increment the count of the current number in the map `num` and return false.\n10.

Some squares of the field are considered impassable (walls), all other squares of the fields are passable.\n\nYou control a snake, the snake consists of segments. Each segment takes up exactly one passable square of the field, but any passable square contains at most one segment. All segments are indexed by integers from 1 to k, where k is the snake's length. The 1-th segment is the head and the k-th segment is the tail. For any i (1 \u2264 i < k), segments with indexes i and i + 1 are located in the adjacent squares of the field, that is, these squares share a common side.\n\nOne of the passable field squares contains an apple. The snake's aim is to reach the apple and eat it (that is, to position its head in the square with the apple).\n\nThe snake moves throughout the game. During one move the snake can move its head to an adjacent field square. All other segments follow the head. That is, each segment number i (1 < i \u2264 k) moves to the square that has just had segment number i - 1. Consider that all segments including the head move simultaneously (see the second test sample). If the snake's head moves to an unpassable square or to the square, occupied by its other segment, the snake dies. That's why we will consider such moves unvalid.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of valid moves that the snake needs to reach the apple.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 15) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the game field.\n\nNext n lines describe the game field. Each of these lines contains m characters. Character \"#\" represents a wall, \".\" is a passable square, \"@\" is an apple.

The snake's aim is to reach the apple and eat it (that is, to position its head in the square with the apple).\n\nThe snake moves throughout the game.

That is, each segment number i (1 < i \u2264 k) moves to the square that has just had segment number i - 1. Consider that all segments including the head move simultaneously (see the second test sample). If the snake's head moves to an unpassable square or to the square, occupied by its other segment, the snake dies. That's why we will consider such moves unvalid.\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of valid moves that the snake needs to reach the apple.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 15) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the game field.\n\nNext n lines describe the game field.

The snake's first segment is represented by character \"1\", the second one segment \u2014 by character \"2\" and so on.\n\nThe game field description doesn't contain any characters besides \"#', \".\", \"@\" and digits (except 0). It is guaranteed that the described field is correct. It is guaranteed that the described field contains exactly one apple and exactly one snake, the snake's length is at least 3 and at most 9.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer to the output \u2014 the minimum number of moves needed to reach the apple.

Iterate over all circles and check if they are inside any of the circles calculated in steps 3 and 4. If a circle is inside another circle, mark the corresponding index in the `vis` array.\n6. Count the number of circles that are not marked in the `vis` array. If this count is 0, print -1. Otherwise, print the maximum distance calculated in step 3.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst double eps = 1e-8;\nconst double inf = 1e20;\nconst double pi = acos(-1.0);\nconst int maxp = 10020;\n\n// Function to calculate the sign of a number\nint sgn(double x) {\n  if (fabs(x) < eps) return 0;\n  if (x < 0)\n    return -1;\n  else\n    return 1;\n}\n\n// Function to calculate the absolute value of a number\ndouble Abs(double x) { return x * sgn(x); }\n\n// Structure to represent a point\nstruct Point {\n  double x, y;\n  Point() {}\n  Point(double _x, double _y) {\n    x = _x;\n    y = _y;\n  }\n  // Function to read a point from the input\n  void input() { scanf(\"%lf%lf\", &x, &y); }\n  // Function to print a point\n  void output() { printf(\"%.2f %.2f\\n\", x, y); }\n  // Overload the equality operator for points\n  bool operator==(Point b) const {\n    return sgn(x - b.x) == 0 && sgn(y - b.y) == 0;\n  }\n  // Overload the less-than operator for points\n  bool operator<(Point b) const {\n    return sgn(x - b.x) == 0?

        "instruction": "The polar bears have discovered a gigantic circular piece of floating ice with some mystic carvings on it. There are n lines carved on the ice. Each line connects two points on the boundary of the ice (we call these points endpoints). The endpoints are numbered 1, 2, ..., 2n counter-clockwise along the circumference. No two lines share an endpoint.\n\nNow a group of 6 polar bears (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Eve, Frank) are going to build caves on the endpoints. Each polar bear would build a cave and live in it. No two polar bears can build a cave on the same endpoints. Alice and Bob is a pair of superstitious lovers. They believe the lines are carved by aliens (or humans, which are pretty much the same thing to polar bears), and have certain spiritual power. Therefore they want to build their caves on two endpoints which are connected by a line. The same for Carol and Dave, Eve and Frank.\n\nThe distance between two caves X and Y is defined as one plus minimum number of other caves one need to pass through in order to travel from X to Y along the boundary of the ice (endpoints without caves are not counted).\n\nTo ensure fairness, the distances between the three pairs of lovers have to be the same (that is, the distance between Alice and Bob, the distance between Carol and Dave, and the distance between Eve and Frank are the same).\n\nThe figures below show two different configurations, where the dots on the circle are the endpoints. The configuration on the left is not valid. Although each pair of lovers (A and B, C and D, E and F) is connected a line, the distance requirement is not satisfied. The distance between A and B is 2 (one can go from A to B in the clockwise direction passing through F). The distance between E and F is also 2. However, the distance between C and D is 1 (one can go from C to D in the counter-clockwise direction without passing through any other caves). The configuration on the right is valid. All three pairs have the same distance 1.\n\n<image>\n\nCount the number of ways to build the caves under the requirements.

Create an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given lines, where each line connects two endpoints.\n3. Initialize a bit array `bit` of size `2n + 1` to keep track of the number of caves built on each endpoint.\n4. Initialize a variable `res` to store the total number of valid configurations.\n5. Iterate through each endpoint `i` from `1` to `2n`.\n6. If `i` is connected to itself (i.e., `p[i] == i`), skip this endpoint.\n7. Calculate the number of caves built on the left side of `i` using the `get` function, which returns the cumulative sum of the bit array up to `i`.\n8. Calculate the number of caves built on the right side of `i` using the `get` function, which returns the cumulative sum of the bit array up to `p[i]`.\n9. Calculate the number of endpoints between `i` and `p[i]` (excluding `i` and `p[i]`) using the formula `(i - p[i] - 1) - 2 * x`, where `x` is the number of caves built on the left side of `i`.\n10. Calculate the number of endpoints between `i` and `p[i]` (excluding `i` and `p[i]`) using the formula `z = (i - p[i] - 1) - 2 * x`.\n11. Calculate the number of endpoints between `i` and `p[i]` (excluding `i` and `p[i]`) using the formula `y = n - 1 - x - z`.\n12.

        "instruction": "The polar bears have discovered a gigantic circular piece of floating ice with some mystic carvings on it. There are n lines carved on the ice. Each line connects two points on the boundary of the ice (we call these points endpoints). The endpoints are numbered 1, 2, ..., 2n counter-clockwise along the circumference. No two lines share an endpoint.\n\nNow a group of 6 polar bears (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Eve, Frank) are going to build caves on the endpoints. Each polar bear would build a cave and live in it. No two polar bears can build a cave on the same endpoints. Alice and Bob is a pair of superstitious lovers. They believe the lines are carved by aliens (or humans, which are pretty much the same thing to polar bears), and have certain spiritual power. Therefore they want to build their caves on two endpoints which are connected by a line. The same for Carol and Dave, Eve and Frank.\n\nThe distance between two caves X and Y is defined as one plus minimum number of other caves one need to pass through in order to travel from X to Y along the boundary of the ice (endpoints without caves are not counted).\n\nTo ensure fairness, the distances between the three pairs of lovers have to be the same (that is, the distance between Alice and Bob, the distance between Carol and Dave, and the distance between Eve and Frank are the same).\n\nThe figures below show two different configurations, where the dots on the circle are the endpoints. The configuration on the left is not valid. Although each pair of lovers (A and B, C and D, E and F) is connected a line, the distance requirement is not satisfied. The distance between A and B is 2 (one can go from A to B in the clockwise direction passing through F). The distance between E and F is also 2. However, the distance between C and D is 1 (one can go from C to D in the counter-clockwise direction without passing through any other caves). The configuration on the right is valid. All three pairs have the same distance 1.\n\n<image>\n\nCount the number of ways to build the caves under the requirements. Two configurations are considered the same if the same set of 6 endpoints are used.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer n(3 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of lines.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains two integers ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 2n), which means that there is a line carved on the ice connecting the ai\u2013th and bi\u2013th endpoint. \n\nIt's guaranteed that each endpoints touches exactly one line.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the number of ways to build the caves.\n\nPlease, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4\n5 4\n1 2\n6 7\n8 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n8\n1 7\n2 4\n3 9\n5 11\n6 8\n10 16\n13 15\n14 12\n\n\nOutput\n\n6\n\nNote\n\nThe second sample corresponds to the figure in the problem statement.",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input: The first line contains the integer n, which represents the number of lines carved on the ice. Each of the following n lines contains two integers ai, bi, which means that there is a line carved on the ice connecting the ai-th and bi-th endpoint.\n2. Preprocess the input: Sort the endpoints based on their x-coordinates in descending order and then based on their y-coordinates in descending order. This is done to ensure that the BIT (Binary Indexed Tree) can be used efficiently.\n3. Build the BIT: Use the BIT to calculate the number of endpoints to the left of each endpoint. This is done by iterating over the sorted endpoints and updating the BIT accordingly.\n4. Calculate the distances: Calculate the distances between each pair of endpoints using the BIT. The distance between two endpoints is defined as one plus the minimum number of other endpoints one needs to pass through in order to travel from one endpoint to the other along the boundary of the ice.\n5. Calculate the number of valid configurations: Calculate the number of valid configurations by considering the constraints imposed by the distances between the endpoints. The constraints are that the distances between the three pairs of lovers (Alice and Bob, Carol and Dave, Eve and Frank) must be the same.\n6. Calculate the final answer: Calculate the final answer by subtracting the number of invalid configurations from the total number of configurations.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntemplate <typename T>\ninline T gi() {\n  T f = 1, x = 0;\n  char c = getchar();\n  while (c < '0' || c > '9') {\n    if (c == '-') f = -1;\n    c = getchar();\n  }\n  while (c >= '0' && c <= '9') x = x * 10 + c - '0', c = getchar();\n  return f * x;\n}\nconst int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f, N = 100003, M = N << 1;\nint n;\nstruct Node {\n  int x, y, id;\n} a[N];\nint l[N], r[N];\ninline bool cmp1(Node x, Node y) { return x.x > y.x; }\ninline bool cmp2(Node x, Node y) { return x.y > y.y; }\ninline bool cmp3(Node x, Node y) { return x.x < y.x; }\nnamespace BIT {\nint tr[M];\nvoid add(int x, int val) {\n  // Update the BIT at index x by adding val\n  for (int i = x; i <= n * 2; i += (i & (-i))) tr[i] += val;\n}\nint query(int x) {\n  // Query the BIT at index x and return the sum of values from 1 to x\n  int res = 0;\n  for (int i = x; i; i -= (i & (-i))) res += tr[i];\n  return res;\n}\n}  // namespace BIT\nint main() {\n  n = gi<int>();\n  // Read the input and preprocess it\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 1)\n    a[i].x = gi<int>(), a[i].y = gi<int>(), a[i].id = i;\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 1)\n    if (a[i].x > a[i].y) swap(a[i].x, a[i].y);\n  sort(a + 1, a + 1 + n, cmp1);\n  // Build the BIT to calculate the number of endpoints to the left of each endpoint\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 1)\n    l[a[i].id] = BIT ::query(a[i].y - 1), BIT ::add(a[i].y, 1);\n  memset(BIT ::tr, 0, sizeof BIT ::tr);\n  sort(a + 1, a + 1 + n, cmp3);\n  // Calculate the distances between each pair of endpoints\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 1)\n    r[a[i].id] =\n        BIT ::query(a[i].x - 1) + BIT ::query(n * 2) - BIT ::query(a[i].y),\n    BIT ::add(a[i].y, 1);\n  memset(BIT ::tr, 0, sizeof BIT ::tr);\n  sort(a + 1, a + 1 + n, cmp2);\n  // Calculate the distances between each pair of endpoints\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 1)\n    r[a[i].id] += BIT ::query(2 * n) - BIT ::query(a[i].y),\n        BIT ::add(a[i].x, 1);\n  // Calculate the total number of configurations\n  long long ans = 1ll * n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6;\n  // Subtract the number of invalid configurations\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 1) ans -= 1ll * l[i] * r[i];\n  // Calculate the number of valid configurations\n  long long res = 0;\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 1)\n    res += 1ll * (l[i] + r[i]) * (n - l[i] - r[i] - 1);\n  // Print the final answer\n  cout << ans - res / 2 << endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

Manao can insert additional nucleotides into the DNA stretch. Each additional nucleotide is a character from the set {'A', 'T', 'G', 'C'}. Manao wants to determine the minimum number of insertions necessary to make the DNA encode a functional protein.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of a single line, containing a string s of length n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Each character of s will be from the set {'A', 'T', 'G', 'C'}.\n\nThis problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 3 points for the correct submission.\n\nOutput\n\nThe program should print on one line a single integer representing the minimum number of 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C' characters that are required to be inserted into the input string in order to make all runs of identical characters have odd length.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\nGTTAAAG\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\nAACCAACCAAAAC\n\n\nOutput\n\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, it is sufficient to insert a single nucleotide of any type between the two 'T's in the sequence to restore the functionality of the protein.",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input string `s` from the user.\n2. Initialize variables `inserire` to 0, `i` to 0, and `passo` to 1. `inserire` will store the minimum number of insertions required, `i` will be used as an index to traverse the string, and `passo` will store the length of the current sequence of consecutive identical nucleotides.\n3. Iterate through the string `s` using a while loop, starting from index `i` and incrementing `i` at each iteration.\n4. Inside the loop, check if the current character `s[i]` is the same as the next character `s[i + 1]`. If they are the same, increment `passo` by 1.\n5. If the current character `s[i]` is different from the next character `s[i + 1]`, it means we have reached the end of a sequence of consecutive identical nucleotides. Check if the length of the sequence (`passo`) is even. If it is even, increment `inserire` by 1 to account for the insertion required to make the sequence have an odd length.\n6. Reset `passo` to 1 to start counting the length of the next sequence of consecutive identical nucleotides.\n7.

This is because each good set can be filled in two ways (with 'x' or 'o'), and we need to exclude the two cases where all cells are filled with the same character.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to read an integer from input\ninline int Read() {\n  int x(0), f(1);\n  char c(getchar());\n  // Skip non-digit characters\n  while (c < '0' || '9' < c) {\n    if (c == '-') {\n      f = -1;\n    }\n    c = getchar();\n  }\n  // Read the integer\n  while ('0' <= c && c <= '9') {\n    x = (x << 1) + (x << 3) + c - '0';\n    c = getchar();\n  }\n  return f * x;\n}\n\n// Function to write an integer to output\nvoid Write(int x) {\n  if (x < 0) {\n    printf(\"-\");\n    x = -x;\n  }\n  // Write the integer in reverse order\n  if (9 < x) {\n    Write(x / 10);\n  }\n  putchar(x % 10 + '0');\n}\n\n// Function to write an integer followed by a newline to output\ninline void Writeln(int x) {\n  Write(x);\n  puts(\"\");\n}\n\n// Define constants for maximum size and modulo value\nconst int MAXN = 2e5 + 5;\nconst long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;\n\n// Function to calculate the power of a number modulo MOD\nlong long Pow(long long a, long long b, long long mod = MOD) {\n  if (b < 1) {\n    return 1;\n  }\n  long long result = 1;\n  // Calculate the power using exponentiation by squaring\n  while (b) {\n    if (b & 1) {\n      result *= a;\n      result %= mod;\n    }\n    a *= a;\n    a %= mod;\n    b /= 2;\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\n// Main function\nint main() {\n  // Read the input values for n and m\n  scanf(\"%d%d\", &n, &m);\n  \n  // Initialize the father array\n  for (int i = 0; i <= n * 2 + 3; ++i) {\n    father[i] = i;\n  }\n  \n  // Process each cell with an initial character\n  int x, y;\n  char ch;\n  for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {\n    scanf(\"%d%d\", &x, &y);\n    ch = getchar();\n    // Skip non-'o' and non-'x' characters\n    while (ch!= 'o' && ch!= 'x') {\n      ch = getchar();\n    }\n    // Calculate the length of the diagonal and the position of the cell on the diagonal\n    int len = abs(x - y);\n    int place = min(x + y, 2 * n + 2 - (x + y));\n    \n    // Merge the corresponding sets in the disjoint-set data structure\n    Merge(len * 2, 2 * place + (ch == 'o'));\n    Merge(len * 2 + 1, 2 * place + (ch == 'x'));\n  }\n  \n  // Check if there are any sets that contain both even and odd indices\n  for (int i = 0; i <= n + 1; ++i) {\n    if (Find(2 * i) == Find(2 * i + 1)) {\n      printf(\"0\\n\");\n      return 0;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Count the number of sets that contain only even or only odd indices\n  int cnt = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i <= 2 * n + 3; ++i) {\n    cnt += father[i] == i;\n  }\n  \n  // Calculate the final answer\n  printf(\"%lld\\n\", Pow(2, cnt / 2 - 2));\n  \n  return 0;\n}\n```",

Tanya is satisfied if there is no integer i (0 \u2264 i < n) such that ai + ai + n + ai + 2n \u2260 6, where ai is the number of coins gnome i has.\n2. Identify the key constraint: The key constraint is that ai + ai + n + ai + 2n \u2260 6 for any i. This can be simplified to 3ai + 3n \u2260 6, which further simplifies to 3ai \u2260 6 - 3n.\n3.

Use combinatorics: We can use combinatorics to count the number of ways to distribute coins. Since there are 3n gnomes and each gnome can have from 1 to 3n - 1 coins, we can think of this as distributing 3n - 1 identical objects (coins) into 3n distinct boxes (gnomes).\n5. Use the formula for combinations with repetition: The number of ways to distribute k identical objects into n distinct boxes is given by the formula C(k + n - 1, n - 1), where C(a, b) is the binomial coefficient \"a choose b\".\n6. Apply the formula: In our case, k = 3n - 1 and n = 3n. So, the number of ways to distribute coins is C(3n + 3n - 1, 3n - 1) = C(6n - 1, 3n - 1).\n7. Use the property of binomial coefficients: We can use the property C(a, b) = C(a, a - b) to simplify the expression. So, C(6n - 1, 3n - 1) = C(6n - 1, 2n + 1).\n8. Use the property of binomial coefficients again: We can use the property C(a, b) = (a! / (b! * (a - b)!)) to calculate the binomial coefficient.\n9.

It is supposed to conduct exactly x\u00b7y tests, each time a mine is installed into a square that has never been used before. The starting cell of the robot always remains the same.\n\nAfter placing the objects on the field the robot will have to run a sequence of commands given by string s, consisting only of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'.
