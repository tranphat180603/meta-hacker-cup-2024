        "instruction": "John has just bought a new car and is planning a journey around the country. Country has N cities, some of which are connected by bidirectional roads. There are N - 1 roads and every city is reachable from any other city. Cities are labeled from 1 to N.\n\nJohn first has to select from which city he will start his journey. After that, he spends one day in a city and then travels to a randomly choosen city which is directly connected to his current one and which he has not yet visited. He does this until he can't continue obeying these rules.\n\nTo select the starting city, he calls his friend Jack for advice. Jack is also starting a big casino business and wants to open casinos in some of the cities (max 1 per city, maybe nowhere). Jack knows John well and he knows that if he visits a city with a casino, he will gamble exactly once before continuing his journey.\n\nHe also knows that if John enters a casino in a good mood, he will leave it in a bad mood and vice versa. Since he is John's friend, he wants him to be in a good mood at the moment when he finishes his journey. John is in a good mood before starting the journey.\n\nIn how many ways can Jack select a starting city for John and cities where he will build casinos such that no matter how John travels, he will be in a good mood at the end? Print answer modulo 109 + 7.\n\nInput\n\nIn the first line, a positive integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100000), the number of cities. \n\nIn the next N - 1 lines, two numbers a, b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 N) separated by a single space meaning that cities a and b are connected by a bidirectional road.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput one number, the answer to the problem modulo 109 + 7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n10\n\nNote\n\nExample 1: If Jack selects city 1 as John's starting city, he can either build 0 casinos, so John will be happy all the time, or build a casino in both cities, so John would visit a casino in city 1, become unhappy, then go to city 2, visit a casino there and become happy and his journey ends there because he can't go back to city 1. If Jack selects city 2 for start, everything is symmetrical, so the answer is 4.\n\nExample 2: If Jack tells John to start from city 1, he can either build casinos in 0 or 2 cities (total 4 possibilities). If he tells him to start from city 2, then John's journey will either contain cities 2 and 1 or 2 and 3. Therefore, Jack will either have to build no casinos, or build them in all three cities. With other options, he risks John ending his journey unhappy. Starting from 3 is symmetric to starting from 1, so in total we have 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 options.",

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the number of mountains `n` and their heights `a` from the input.\n2. Calculate the left maximum height for each mountain `i` by maintaining a stack `st` of indices of mountains with greater or equal height. The left maximum height is the number of mountains between the current mountain and the last mountain in the stack.\n3. Calculate the right maximum height for each mountain `i` by maintaining a stack `st` of indices of mountains with greater or equal height. The right maximum height is the number of mountains between the current mountain and the last mountain in the stack.\n4. Calculate the left boost for each mountain `i` by iterating over the bits of the mountain height. If the bit is set, the best previous mountain with the same bit set is stored. If the bit is not set, the maximum of the best previous mountains with the same bit set is taken as the left boost.\n5. Calculate the right boost for each mountain `i` by iterating over the bits of the mountain height. If the bit is set, the best next mountain with the same bit set is stored. If the bit is not set, the minimum of the best next mountains with the same bit set is taken as the right boost.\n6. Iterate over the mountains and for each mountain `i`, calculate the number of valid pairs `(l, r)` where `l` is the left maximum height and `r` is the right maximum height. The number of valid pairs is calculated using the countCase function.\n7.

Recently they discovered an interesting acoustic characteristic of this ridge: if Rick and Morty begin crying simultaneously from different mountains, their cry would be heard between these mountains up to the height equal the bitwise OR of mountains they've climbed and all the mountains between them. \n\nBitwise OR is a binary operation which is determined the following way. Consider representation of numbers x and y in binary numeric system (probably with leading zeroes) x = xk... x1x0 and y = yk... y1y0. Then z = x | y is defined following way: z = zk... z1z0, where zi = 1, if xi = 1 or yi = 1, and zi = 0 otherwise. In the other words, digit of bitwise OR of two numbers equals zero if and only if digits at corresponding positions is both numbers equals zero. For example bitwise OR of numbers 10 = 10102 and 9 = 10012 equals 11 = 10112.

Your task is to repair such roads (possibly all or none) that will maximize your profit. Your profit is defined as the total money you get from the races that are held minus the total money you spent to repair the roads. Note that you may decide not to repair any road and gain zero profit.\n\nPrint the maximum profit you can gain.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two single-space separated integers, n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2\u00b7105), denoting the number of roads and the number of races, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follow, each line will contain a single non-negative integer not exceeding 109 denoting the cost to repair a road. The costs are given in order from road 1 to road n.\n\nFinally, m lines follow. Each line is single-space-separated triplets of integers. Each triplet will be given as lb, ub, and p (1 \u2264 lb \u2264 ub \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 109), which means that the race these three integers describe will use all the roads from lb to ub, inclusive, and if it's held you get p.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer denoting the maximum possible profit you can gain.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++.

Preprocess the input data by handling special cases where a wall is almost horizontal or vertical, and by removing duplicate edges.\n3. Convert the warehouse edges into a format suitable for the algorithm, which involves calculating the angle of each edge and storing it in the point structure.\n4. Initialize the main algorithm by setting up the initial range of angles (-PI - 0.001 to PI + 0.001) and the initial minimum and maximum points (mn and mn1).\n5. Iterate through the edges of the warehouses, checking if each edge intersects with the current range of angles. If it does, update the minimum and maximum points (mn and mn1) accordingly.\n6. If the current edge does not intersect with the current range of angles, recursively call the calc function with the left and right halves of the current range of angles.\n7.

Iterate through possible values of `y`: Iterate through possible values of `y` (the length of the logs in the raft) from 2 to the maximum length of a log.\n5. Calculate the total count of logs of length `y`: Calculate the total count of logs of length `y` by iterating through the lengths of the logs and counting the number of logs that are at least `y` long.\n6.

Initialize the data structures: Initialize the adjacency list `g` to store the edges of the tree, and the arrays `sz`, `l`, `r`, `inv`, `ans`, and `all` to store the size of each subtree, the lower and upper bounds of each vertex's color, the inverse of each vertex's color range, the sum of values of all possible trees, and the total number of possible trees, respectively.\n3. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the size of each subtree: The DFS function `dfs` calculates the size of each subtree rooted at vertex `v` by recursively visiting its children.\n4. Find the centroid of the tree: The function `find_centroid` finds the centroid of the tree by recursively searching for the vertex with the largest subtree that is smaller than half the total number of vertices.\n5. Update the segment tree: The function `calc` updates the segment tree by adding the contribution of vertex `v` to the sum of values of all possible trees. If `upd` is `true`, it also updates the segment tree with the contribution of vertex `v` to the total number of possible trees.\n6. Recursively solve the subproblems: The function `solve` recursively solves the subproblems by visiting each child of the centroid and calculating the sum of values of all possible trees for each child.\n7.
