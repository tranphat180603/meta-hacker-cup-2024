Create a 2D array `pref` to store the indices of the cities in the sorted vector `V`.\n8. Create a 2D array `revpos` to store the indices of the cities in the original vector `V`.\n9. Call the `cpp_wrapper_irving` function to find a stable pairing of cities.\n10. If a stable pairing is found, output the pairing; otherwise, output `-1`.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to find a stable pairing of cities\nvoid cpp_wrapper_irving(int N) {\n  // Arrays to store the current proposals and proposed pairings\n  int proposal_to[N];\n  int proposal_from[N];\n  int proposed_to[N];\n\n  // Initialize the arrays\n  for (int i = 0;

While there are still arrays to be selected, do the following:\n   - For each selected array, update the count of each element in each row of `b`.\n   - Find an array `uniq` that has exactly one element in each row of `b` that has a count of 1.\n   - If such an array is found, add it to the result and mark all other arrays that have the same element in the same position as selected.\n   - If no such array is found, add the first unselected array to the result and mark it as selected.\n7. Calculate the number of good subsets by multiplying the number of selected arrays by 2 for each test case.\n8. Print the number of good subsets and the indices of the arrays that form a good subset.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n#define int long long\nusing namespace std;\nconst int N=505;\nconst int mo=998244353;\n\n// Function to calculate x^n modulo mo\nint Pow(int x,int n) {\n    int ans=1;\n    while (n) {\n        if (n&1) ans=ans*x%mo; // Multiply ans by x if n is odd\n        x=x*x%mo; // Square x\n        n>>=1; // Divide n by 2\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n\n// Main function\nsigned main() {\n    int t; scanf(\"%lld\",&t); // Read the number of test cases\n    while (t--) {\n        // Initialize variables\n        vector<int>an; // Store the indices of the arrays that form a good subset\n        long long ans=1ll; // Store the number of good subsets\n        int n; scanf(\"%lld\",&n); // Read the size of the arrays\n        for (int i=1;i<=2*n;i++) // Read 2n arrays\n            for (int j=1;j<=n;j++)\n                scanf(\"%lld\",&a[i][j]); // Read each array\n        int tot=0; // Initialize a counter\n        for (int i=1;i<=2*n;i++) f[i]=false; // Initialize the boolean array f\n\n        // Main loop\n        while (true) {\n            // Reset the 2D array b\n            for (int i=1;i<=n;i++)\n                for (int j=1;j<=n;j++)\n                    b[i][j]=0;\n\n            // Update the count of each element in each row of b\n            for (int i=1;i<=2*n;i++) if (!f[i]) {\n                    for (int j=1;j<=n;j++)\n                        b[j][a[i][j]]++; // Increment the count of each element\n                }\n\n            // Find an array uniq that has exactly one element in each row of b that has a count of 1\n            bool cc; int uniq;\n            for (int i=1;i<=2*n;i++) if (!f[i]) {\n                    cc=false;\n                    for (int j=1;j<=n;j++) if (b[j][a[i][j]]==1) {\n                            cc=true; uniq=i; break; // Found such an array\n                        }\n                    if (cc) break;\n                }\n\n            // If such an array is found, add it to the result and mark all other arrays that have the same element in the same position as selected\n            if (cc) {\n                an.push_back(uniq);\n            }\n            // If no such array is found, add the first unselected array to the result and mark it as selected\n            else {\n                for (int i=1;i<=2*n;i++) if (!f[i]) {\n                        uniq=i; break; // Find the first unselected array\n                    }\n                an.push_back(uniq);\n                ans=ans*2ll%mo; // Multiply the number of good subsets by 2\n            }\n\n            // Mark all other arrays that have the same element in the same position as selected\n            for (int i=1;i<=2*n;i++) if (!f[i]) {\n                    bool flag=true;\n                    for (int j=1;j<=n;j++) if (a[i][j]==a[uniq][j]) {\n                            flag=false; break; // Check if the array has the same element in the same position\n                        }\n                    if (!flag) f[i]=true; // Mark the array as selected\n                }\n\n            // If the result has n arrays, break the loop\n            if (an.size()==n) break;\n        }\n\n        // Print the number of good subsets and the indices of the arrays that form a good subset\n        printf(\"%lld\\n\",ans);\n        for (int i=0;i<an.size();i++) printf(\"%lld \",an[i]);\n        puts(\"\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```",

These arrays are special: for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, if we take the i-th element of each array and form another array of length n with these elements, the resultant array is also a permutation of n integers from 1 to n. In the other words, if you put these n arrays under each other to form a matrix with n rows and n columns, this matrix is a [Latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square).\n\nAfterwards, Cirno added additional n arrays, each array is a permutation of n integers from 1 to n. For all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, there exists at least one position 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, such that for the i-th array and the (n + i)-th array, the k-th element of both arrays is the same. Notice that the arrays indexed from n + 1 to 2n don't have to form a Latin square. \n\nAlso, Cirno made sure that for all 2n arrays, no two arrays are completely equal, i. e. for all pair of indices 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 2n, there exists at least one position 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, such that the k-th elements of the i-th and j-th array are different.\n\nFinally, Cirno arbitrarily changed the order of 2n arrays.\n\nAquaMoon calls a subset of all 2n arrays of size n good if these arrays from a Latin square.\n\nAquaMoon wants to know how many good subsets exist. Because this number may be particularly large, find it modulo 998 244 353. Also, she wants to find any good subset. Can you help her?\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (5 \u2264 n \u2264 500).\n\nThen 2n lines followed. The i-th of these lines contains n integers, representing the i-th array.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 500.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print two lines.\n\nIn the first line, print the number of good subsets by modulo 998 244 353.\n\nIn the second line, print n indices from 1 to 2n \u2014 indices of the n arrays that form a good subset (you can print them in any order).

Count the occurrences of each element in the arrays: Iterate through the arrays and update the `cnt` array to count the occurrences of each element in each column.\n4. Find a good subset: Use a recursive function `solve2` to find a good subset of arrays that form a Latin square. The function works by iteratively adding arrays to the subset and deleting arrays that share an element with the added array.\n5. Calculate the total number of good subsets: After finding a good subset, calculate the total number of good subsets by multiplying the size of the subset by 2 raised to the power of the number of remaining arrays.\n6.

Every day at least k people must work in the store.\n\nBerland has a law that determines the order of working days and non-working days. Namely, each employee must work for exactly n consecutive days, then rest for exactly m days, then work for n more days and rest for m more, and so on. Vitaly doesn't want to break the law. Fortunately, there is a loophole: the law comes into force on the day when the employee is hired. For example, if an employee is hired on day x, then he should work on days [x, x + 1, ..., x + n - 1], [x + m + n, x + m + n + 1, ..., x + m + 2n - 1], and so on. Day x can be chosen arbitrarily by Vitaly.\n\nThere is one more thing: the key to the store. Berland law prohibits making copies of keys, so there is only one key. Vitaly is planning to entrust the key to the store employees. At the same time on each day the key must be with an employee who works that day \u2014 otherwise on this day no one can get inside the store. During the day the key holder can give the key to another employee, if he also works that day. The key will handed to the first hired employee at his first working day.\n\nEach employee has to be paid salary. Therefore, Vitaly wants to hire as few employees as possible provided that the store can operate normally on each day from 1 to infinity. In other words, on each day with index from 1 to infinity, the store must have at least k working employees, and one of the working employees should have the key to the store.\n\nHelp Vitaly and determine the minimum required number of employees, as well as days on which they should be hired.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264 1000, n \u2260 1, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 1000).\n\nOutput\n\nIn the first line print a single integer z \u2014 the minimum required number of employees.\n\nIn the second line print z positive integers, separated by spaces: the i-th integer ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 104) should represent the number of the day, on which Vitaly should hire the i-th employee.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4 3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n1 1 4 5\n\nInput\n\n3 3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n1 3 5",

Each node i has an initial value initi, which is either 0 or 1. The root of the tree is node 1.\n\nOne can perform several (possibly, zero) operations on the tree during the game. The only available type of operation is to pick a node x. Right after someone has picked node x, the value of node x flips, the values of sons of x remain the same, the values of sons of sons of x flips, the values of sons of sons of sons of x remain the same and so on.\n\nThe goal of the game is to get each node i to have value goali, which can also be only 0 or 1.

Calculate the parity of the path: During the DFS, calculate the parity of the path from the root to each node by XORing the initial value of the current node with the parity of its parent node.\n5.

Create an adjacency list: The input edges are used to create an adjacency list `adj` for the tree. Each node `u` has a list of its neighbors `adj[u]`.\n3. Calculate the difference between initial and goal values: The difference between the initial and goal values of each node is calculated and stored in the list `d`. This difference will be used to determine the parity of the nodes.\n4. Perform DFS: A depth-first search (DFS) is performed on the tree to traverse all nodes. The DFS function `dfs` takes the current node `u`, its parent `p`, the current level `c_lvl`, the parent level `p_lvl`, and the difference list `d` as parameters.\n5. Update the result list: During the DFS, if the current level `c_lvl` is different from the difference `d[u]`, it means that the node's value needs to be flipped. In this case, the current node `u` is added to the result list `res`.\n6. Backtrack: After visiting all children of a node, the DFS backtracks to the parent node.\n7. Print the result: After the DFS is complete, the result list `res` contains the nodes that need to be flipped to reach the goal. The length of `res` is printed as the minimum number of operations required.

This includes the length of the sequence `n`, the sequence of integers `a1,..., an`, and the number of queries `q`.\n2. Initialize the data structures: Initialize a dictionary `d` to store the count of pairs for each gcd value, and another dictionary `current` to store the count of each number in the current window.\n3. Process the sequence: Iterate over the sequence `a1,..., an` and update the `current` dictionary. For each number, calculate the gcd with the previous numbers and update the `current` dictionary accordingly.\n4. Update the `d` dictionary: After processing each number, update the `d` dictionary with the count of pairs for each gcd value.\n5. Handle the special case for gcd 1: Since the problem statement requires counting pairs where `gcd(al, al+1,..., ar) = xi`, we need to handle the special case where `xi = 1`. In this case, we need to count the total number of pairs and subtract the count of pairs for other gcd values.\n6.
