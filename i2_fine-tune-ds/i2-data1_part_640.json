A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle).

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. The problem requires finding the k-th permutation that does not change after applying the described operation. To solve this, we first need to understand the pattern of permutations that remain unchanged.\n2. The given code uses the Fibonacci sequence to calculate the number of permutations that do not change after applying the operation. This is because the permutations that remain unchanged are essentially the permutations where the largest element in each cycle is the first element in the cycle, and the cycles are sorted by their first element.\n3. The code calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to n = 50, as the problem statement specifies that 1 \u2264 n \u2264 50.\n4. The code then uses the calculated Fibonacci sequence to determine the k-th permutation that does not change after applying the operation.\n5. The code iterates through the Fibonacci sequence, starting from n and going down to 1. For each iteration, it checks if the current index i is equal to n. If it is, it checks if k is greater than the Fibonacci number at index i - 1. If it is, it subtracts the Fibonacci number from k and appends 2 to the answer vector. Otherwise, it appends 1 to the answer vector.\n6. If the current index i is not equal to n, it checks if i is equal to 1. If it is, it appends n - 1 to the answer vector if the last element in the answer vector is n. Otherwise, it appends n to the answer vector.\n7. If the current index i is neither equal to n nor 1, it checks if the last element in the answer vector is equal to the current index i. If it is, it appends i - 1 to the answer vector. Otherwise, it checks if k is greater than the Fibonacci number at index i - 1. If it is, it subtracts the Fibonacci number from k and appends i + 2 to the answer vector. Otherwise, it appends i + 1 to the answer vector.\n8.

At the beginning of the workflow the cache is empty. When some object is queried we check if it is present in the cache and move it here if it's not. If there are more than k objects in the cache after this, the least recently used one should be removed. In other words, we remove the object that has the smallest time of the last query.\n\nConsider there are n videos being stored on the server, all of the same size. Cache can store no more than k videos and caching algorithm described above is applied. We know that any time a user enters the server he pick the video i with probability pi.

        "instruction": "After his birthday party, Timofey went to his favorite tree alley in a park. He wants to feed there his favorite birds \u2014 crows.\n\nIt's widely known that each tree is occupied by a single crow family. The trees in the alley form a row and are numbered from 1 to n. Some families are friends to each other. For some reasons, two families can be friends only if they live not too far from each other, more precisely, there is no more than k - 1 trees between any pair of friend families. Formally, the family on the u-th tree and the family on the v-th tree can be friends only if |u - v| \u2264 k holds.\n\nOne of the friendship features is that if some family learns that Timofey is feeding crows somewhere, it notifies about this all friend families. Thus, after Timofey starts to feed crows under some tree, all the families that are friends to the family living on this tree, as well as their friends and so on, fly to the feeding place. Of course, the family living on the tree also comes to the feeding place.\n\nToday Timofey came to the alley and noticed that all the families that live on trees with numbers strictly less than l or strictly greater than r have flown away. Thus, it is not possible to pass the information about feeding through them. Moreover, there is no need to feed them. Help Timofey to learn what is the minimum number of trees under which he has to feed crows so that all the families that have remained will get the information about feeding. You are given several situations, described by integers l and r, you need to calculate the answer for all of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5), where n is the number of trees, and k is the maximum possible distance between friend families.\n\nThe next line contains single integer m (0 \u2264 m \u2264 n\u00b7k) \u2014 the number of pair of friend families. \n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers u and v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 105), that means that the families on trees u and v are friends. It is guaranteed that u \u2260 v and |u - v| \u2264 k. All the given pairs are distinct.\n\nThe next line contains single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of situations you need to calculate the answer in.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 105), that means that in this situation families that have flown away lived on such trees x, so that either x < l or x > r.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q lines. Line i should contain single integer \u2014 the answer in the i-th situation.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n5 3\n3\n1 3\n2 3\n4 5\n5\n1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example the following family pairs are friends: (1, 3), (2, 3) and (4, 5).\n\n  * In the first situation only the first family has remained, so the answer is 1. \n  * In the second situation the first two families have remained, and they aren't friends, so the answer is 2. \n  * In the third situation the families 2 and 3 are friends, so it is enough to feed any of them, the answer is 1. \n  * In the fourth situation we can feed the first family, then the third family will get the information from the first family, and the second family will get the information from the third. The answer is 1. \n  * In the fifth situation we can feed the first and the fifth families, so the answer is 2. ",

        "instruction": "After his birthday party, Timofey went to his favorite tree alley in a park. He wants to feed there his favorite birds \u2014 crows.\n\nIt's widely known that each tree is occupied by a single crow family. The trees in the alley form a row and are numbered from 1 to n. Some families are friends to each other. For some reasons, two families can be friends only if they live not too far from each other, more precisely, there is no more than k - 1 trees between any pair of friend families. Formally, the family on the u-th tree and the family on the v-th tree can be friends only if |u - v| \u2264 k holds.\n\nOne of the friendship features is that if some family learns that Timofey is feeding crows somewhere, it notifies about this all friend families. Thus, after Timofey starts to feed crows under some tree, all the families that are friends to the family living on this tree, as well as their friends and so on, fly to the feeding place. Of course, the family living on the tree also comes to the feeding place.\n\nToday Timofey came to the alley and noticed that all the families that live on trees with numbers strictly less than l or strictly greater than r have flown away. Thus, it is not possible to pass the information about feeding through them. Moreover, there is no need to feed them. Help Timofey to learn what is the minimum number of trees under which he has to feed crows so that all the families that have remained will get the information about feeding. You are given several situations, described by integers l and r, you need to calculate the answer for all of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5), where n is the number of trees, and k is the maximum possible distance between friend families.\n\nThe next line contains single integer m (0 \u2264 m \u2264 n\u00b7k) \u2014 the number of pair of friend families. \n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers u and v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 105), that means that the families on trees u and v are friends. It is guaranteed that u \u2260 v and |u - v| \u2264 k. All the given pairs are distinct.\n\nThe next line contains single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of situations you need to calculate the answer in.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 105), that means that in this situation families that have flown away lived on such trees x, so that either x < l or x > r.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q lines. Line i should contain single integer \u2014 the answer in the i-th situation.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n5 3\n3\n1 3\n2 3\n4 5\n5\n1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example the following family pairs are friends: (1, 3), (2, 3) and (4, 5).\n\n  * In the first situation only the first family has remained, so the answer is 1. \n  * In the second situation the first two families have remained, and they aren't friends, so the answer is 2. \n  * In the third situation the families 2 and 3 are friends, so it is enough to feed any of them, the answer is 1. \n  * In the fourth situation we can feed the first family, then the third family will get the information from the first family, and the second family will get the information from the third. The answer is 1. \n  * In the fifth situation we can feed the first and the fifth families, so the answer is 2. ",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input values for n (number of trees), k (maximum distance between friend families), and m (number of pairs of friend families).\n2. Create an adjacency list representation of the friendship graph, where each tree is a node, and two nodes are connected if the corresponding families are friends.\n3. Initialize a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of connected components in the graph.\n4. Read the queries, where each query consists of two integers l and r, representing the range of trees from which families have flown away.\n5. For each query, find the minimum number of trees that need to be fed to ensure that all remaining families get the information about feeding.\n6.

        "instruction": "After long-term research and lots of experiments leading Megapolian automobile manufacturer \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb released a brand new car model named \u00abLada Malina\u00bb. One of the most impressive features of \u00abLada Malina\u00bb is its highly efficient environment-friendly engines.\n\nConsider car as a point in Oxy plane. Car is equipped with k engines numbered from 1 to k. Each engine is defined by its velocity vector whose coordinates are (vxi, vyi) measured in distance units per day. An engine may be turned on at any level wi, that is a real number between  - 1 and  + 1 (inclusive) that result in a term of (wi\u00b7vxi, wi\u00b7vyi) in the final car velocity. Namely, the final car velocity is equal to \n\n(w1\u00b7vx1 + w2\u00b7vx2 + ... + wk\u00b7vxk, w1\u00b7vy1 + w2\u00b7vy2 + ... + wk\u00b7vyk)\n\nFormally, if car moves with constant values of wi during the whole day then its x-coordinate will change by the first component of an expression above, and its y-coordinate will change by the second component of an expression above. For example, if all wi are equal to zero, the car won't move, and if all wi are equal to zero except w1 = 1, then car will move with the velocity of the first engine.\n\nThere are n factories in Megapolia, i-th of them is located in (fxi, fyi). On the i-th factory there are ai cars \u00abLada Malina\u00bb that are ready for operation.\n\nAs an attempt to increase sales of a new car, \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to hold an international exposition of cars. There are q options of exposition location and time, in the i-th of them exposition will happen in a point with coordinates (pxi, pyi) in ti days. \n\nOf course, at the \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to bring as much new cars from factories as possible to the place of exposition. Cars are going to be moved by enabling their engines on some certain levels, such that at the beginning of an exposition car gets exactly to the exposition location. \n\nHowever, for some of the options it may be impossible to bring cars from some of the factories to the exposition location by the moment of an exposition. Your task is to determine for each of the options of exposition location and time how many cars will be able to get there by the beginning of an exposition.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers k, n, q (2 \u2264 k \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 105), the number of engines of \u00abLada Malina\u00bb, number of factories producing \u00abLada Malina\u00bb and number of options of an exposition time and location respectively.\n\nThe following k lines contain the descriptions of \u00abLada Malina\u00bb engines. The i-th of them contains two integers vxi, vyi ( - 1000 \u2264 vxi, vyi \u2264 1000) defining the velocity vector of the i-th engine. Velocity vector can't be zero, i.e. at least one of vxi and vyi is not equal to zero. It is guaranteed that no two velosity vectors are collinear (parallel).\n\nNext n lines contain the descriptions of factories. The i-th of them contains two integers fxi, fyi, ai ( - 109 \u2264 fxi, fyi \u2264 109, 1 \u2264 ai \u2264 109) defining the coordinates of the i-th factory location and the number of cars that are located there.\n\nThe following q lines contain the descriptions of the car exposition. The i-th of them contains three integers pxi, pyi, ti ( - 109 \u2264 pxi, pyi \u2264 109, 1 \u2264 ti \u2264 105) defining the coordinates of the exposition location and the number of days till the exposition start in the i-th option.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each possible option of the exposition output the number of cars that will be able to get to the exposition location by the moment of its beginning.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 4 1\n1 1\n-1 1\n2 3 1\n2 -2 1\n-2 1 1\n-2 -2 1\n0 0 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n3 4 3\n2 0\n-1 1\n-1 -2\n-3 0 6\n1 -2 1\n-3 -7 3\n3 2 2\n-1 -4 1\n0 4 2\n6 0 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n9\n0\n\nNote\n\nImages describing sample tests are given below. Exposition options are denoted with crosses, factories are denoted with points. Each factory is labeled with a number of cars that it has.\n\nFirst sample test explanation:\n\n  * Car from the first factory is not able to get to the exposition location in time. \n  * Car from the second factory can get to the exposition in time if we set w1 = 0, w2 = 1. \n  * Car from the third factory can get to the exposition in time if we set <image>, <image>. \n  * Car from the fourth factory can get to the exposition in time if we set w1 = 1, w2 = 0. \n\n<image> <image>",

The last remaining sportsman becomes the winner. Apart of this, the scheme can be arbitrary, it is not disclosed in advance.\n\nVasya knows powers of sportsmen in each kind of sport. He believes that the sportsmen with higher power always wins.\n\nThe tournament is held every year, and each year one new participant joins it. In the first tournament, only one sportsman has participated, in the second there were two sportsmen, and so on. Vasya has been watching the tournament for the last n years. Help him to find the number of possible winners for each of the n tournaments.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b7104, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10) \u2014 the number of tournaments and the number of kinds of sport, respectively.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains k integers si1, si2, ..., sik (1 \u2264 sij \u2264 109), where sij is the power of the i-th sportsman in the j-th kind of sport.

Use the `lower_bound` function to find the first node in the set `s` that is not dominated by `cur` (i.e., `cur` can potentially win against this node). Store this iterator as `it1`.\n5. Iterate from `it1` to the end of the set `s` and merge any nodes that are dominated by `cur` into `cur`. This is done by updating the `lo` and `hi` arrays of `cur` to be the minimum and maximum powers in each kind of sport, respectively, and incrementing the `size` of `cur` by the size of the merged node.\n6.

Specifically, the order went like this:\n\n  * If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the rounded up number coincides with the number\u2019s integer part. \n  * If a number's integer part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less than 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of the number\u2019s integer part.\n  * If the number\u2019s integer part ends with digit 9, to round up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom she is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the next position. \n\n\n\nMerchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked you (the ACMers) to help them. Can you write a program that would perform the rounding according to the King\u2019s order?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single number to round up \u2014 the integer part (a non-empty set of decimal digits that do not start with 0 \u2014 with the exception of a case when the set consists of a single digit \u2014 in this case 0 can go first), then follows character \u00ab.\u00bb (a dot), and then follows the fractional part (any non-empty set of decimal digits). The number's length does not exceed 1000 characters, including the dot. There are no other characters in the input data.\n\nOutput\n\nIf the last number of the integer part is not equal to 9, print the rounded-up number without leading zeroes. Otherwise, print the message \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" (without the quotes).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n0.0\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\nInput\n\n1.49\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\nInput\n\n1.50\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nInput\n\n2.71828182845904523536\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\nInput\n\n3.14159265358979323846\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\nInput\n\n12345678901234567890.1\n\n\nOutput\n\n12345678901234567890\n\nInput\n\n123456789123456789.999\n\n\nOutput\n\nGOTO Vasilisa.",
