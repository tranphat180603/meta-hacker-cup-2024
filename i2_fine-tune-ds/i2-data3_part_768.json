        "instruction": "Emuskald was hired to design an artificial waterfall according to the latest trends in landscape architecture. A modern artificial waterfall consists of multiple horizontal panels affixed to a wide flat wall. The water flows down the top of the wall from panel to panel until it reaches the bottom of the wall.\n\nThe wall has height t and has n panels on the wall. Each panel is a horizontal segment at height hi which begins at li and ends at ri. The i-th panel connects the points (li, hi) and (ri, hi) of the plane. The top of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points ( - 109, t) and (109, t). Similarly, the bottom of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points ( - 109, 0) and (109, 0). No two panels share a common point.\n\nEmuskald knows that for the waterfall to be aesthetically pleasing, it can flow from panel i to panel j (<image>) only if the following conditions hold: \n\n  1. max(li, lj) < min(ri, rj) (horizontal projections of the panels overlap); \n  2. hj < hi (panel j is below panel i); \n  3. there is no such panel k (hj < hk < hi) that the first two conditions hold for the pairs (i, k) and (k, j). \n\n\n\nThen the flow for <image> is equal to min(ri, rj) - max(li, lj), the length of their horizontal projection overlap.\n\nEmuskald has decided that in his waterfall the water will flow in a single path from top to bottom. If water flows to a panel (except the bottom of the wall), the water will fall further to exactly one lower panel. The total amount of water flow in the waterfall is then defined as the minimum horizontal projection overlap between two consecutive panels in the path of the waterfall. Formally: \n\n  1. the waterfall consists of a single path of panels <image>; \n  2. the flow of the waterfall is the minimum flow in the path <image>. \n\n\n\nTo make a truly great waterfall Emuskald must maximize this water flow, but there are too many panels and he is having a hard time planning his creation.

Each of the n following lines contain three space-separated integers hi, li and ri (0 < hi < t,  - 109 \u2264 li < ri \u2264 109), the height, left and right ends of the i-th panel segment.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two segments share a common point.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible amount of water flow in the desired waterfall.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n5 6\n4 1 6\n3 2 7\n5 9 11\n3 10 15\n1 13 16\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n6 5\n4 2 8\n3 1 2\n2 2 3\n2 6 12\n1 0 7\n1 8 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nThe first test case corresponds to the picture.",

        "instruction": "Emuskald was hired to design an artificial waterfall according to the latest trends in landscape architecture. A modern artificial waterfall consists of multiple horizontal panels affixed to a wide flat wall. The water flows down the top of the wall from panel to panel until it reaches the bottom of the wall.\n\nThe wall has height t and has n panels on the wall. Each panel is a horizontal segment at height hi which begins at li and ends at ri. The i-th panel connects the points (li, hi) and (ri, hi) of the plane. The top of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points ( - 109, t) and (109, t). Similarly, the bottom of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the points ( - 109, 0) and (109, 0). No two panels share a common point.\n\nEmuskald knows that for the waterfall to be aesthetically pleasing, it can flow from panel i to panel j (<image>) only if the following conditions hold: \n\n  1. max(li, lj) < min(ri, rj) (horizontal projections of the panels overlap); \n  2. hj < hi (panel j is below panel i); \n  3. there is no such panel k (hj < hk < hi) that the first two conditions hold for the pairs (i, k) and (k, j). \n\n\n\nThen the flow for <image> is equal to min(ri, rj) - max(li, lj), the length of their horizontal projection overlap.\n\nEmuskald has decided that in his waterfall the water will flow in a single path from top to bottom. If water flows to a panel (except the bottom of the wall), the water will fall further to exactly one lower panel. The total amount of water flow in the waterfall is then defined as the minimum horizontal projection overlap between two consecutive panels in the path of the waterfall. Formally: \n\n  1. the waterfall consists of a single path of panels <image>; \n  2. the flow of the waterfall is the minimum flow in the path <image>. \n\n\n\nTo make a truly great waterfall Emuskald must maximize this water flow, but there are too many panels and he is having a hard time planning his creation. Below is an example of a waterfall Emuskald wants:\n\n<image>\n\nHelp Emuskald maintain his reputation and find the value of the maximum possible water flow.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 2 \u2264 t \u2264 109), the number of the panels excluding the top and the bottom panels, and the height of the wall. Each of the n following lines contain three space-separated integers hi, li and ri (0 < hi < t,  - 109 \u2264 li < ri \u2264 109), the height, left and right ends of the i-th panel segment.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two segments share a common point.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible amount of water flow in the desired waterfall.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n5 6\n4 1 6\n3 2 7\n5 9 11\n3 10 15\n1 13 16\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n6 5\n4 2 8\n3 1 2\n2 2 3\n2 6 12\n1 0 7\n1 8 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nThe first test case corresponds to the picture.",

Read the input values `n` and `m`, and the array `val` of size `n`.\n3. Build the segment tree `seg` using the `build` function, which initializes the tree with the values from the array `val`.\n4. Process each operation in the input, which can be of three types:\n   - Type 1: Update the value at index `a` to `v`.\n   - Type 2: Calculate the sum of the Fibonacci numbers from index `l` to `r`.\n   - Type 3: Add `d` to the values from index `l` to `r`.\n5.

So you might be quite surprised to find out that the primary school in Japan teaches to count using a Soroban \u2014 an abacus developed in Japan. This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let's have a look at the Soroban's construction.\n\n<image>\n\nSoroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called go-dama and four others are ichi-damas. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm:\n\n  * Set the value of a digit equal to 0. \n  * If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5. \n  * Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left. \n\n\n\nThus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.\n\nWrite the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number n.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (0 \u2264 n < 109).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the description of the decimal digits of number n from the last one to the first one (as mentioned on the picture in the statement), one per line. Print the beads as large English letters 'O', rod pieces as character '-' and the reckoning bar as '|'. Print as many rods, as many digits are in the decimal representation of number n without leading zeroes. We can assume that number 0 has no leading zeroes.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2\n\n\nOutput\n\nO-|OO-OO\n\n\nInput\n\n13\n\n\nOutput\n\nO-|OOO-O\nO-|O-OOO\n\n\nInput\n\n720\n\n\nOutput\n\nO-|-OOOO\nO-|OO-OO\n-O|OO-OO",

If the digit is less than 5, print the representation of the digit on the Soroban. This involves printing the reckoning bar, followed by 5 'O's (representing the ichi-damas), and then the remaining number of 'O's equal to the digit value.\n5.

Each pair of distinct points is connected by a diagonal, which is colored in one of 26 colors. Points are denoted by lowercase English letters. There are three stones positioned on three distinct vertices. All stones are the same. With one move you can move the stone to another free vertex along some diagonal. The color of this diagonal must be the same as the color of the diagonal, connecting another two stones. \n\nYour goal is to move stones in such way that the only vertices occupied by stones are 1, 2 and 3.

In the BFS, for each point `a1`, `a2`, and `a3` representing the current positions of the stones, explore all possible moves to the neighboring points `v` that have the same color as the diagonal connecting `a2` and `a3`, `a1` and `a3`, or `a1` and `a2`.\n5. If a move is valid (i.e., the neighboring point `v` is not already occupied by a stone), mark the new positions of the stones as visited and add them to the queue `q`.\n6.

        "instruction": "You are playing the following game. There are n points on a plane. They are the vertices of a regular n-polygon. Points are labeled with integer numbers from 1 to n. Each pair of distinct points is connected by a diagonal, which is colored in one of 26 colors. Points are denoted by lowercase English letters. There are three stones positioned on three distinct vertices. All stones are the same. With one move you can move the stone to another free vertex along some diagonal. The color of this diagonal must be the same as the color of the diagonal, connecting another two stones. \n\nYour goal is to move stones in such way that the only vertices occupied by stones are 1, 2 and 3. You must achieve such position using minimal number of moves. Write a program which plays this game in an optimal way.\n\nInput\n\nIn the first line there is one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 70) \u2014 the number of points. In the second line there are three space-separated integer from 1 to n \u2014 numbers of vertices, where stones are initially located.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains n symbols \u2014 the matrix denoting the colors of the diagonals. Colors are denoted by lowercase English letters. The symbol j of line i denotes the color of diagonal between points i and j. Matrix is symmetric, so j-th symbol of i-th line is equal to i-th symbol of j-th line. Main diagonal is filled with '*' symbols because there is no diagonal, connecting point to itself.\n\nOutput\n\nIf there is no way to put stones on vertices 1, 2 and 3, print -1 on a single line. Otherwise, on the first line print minimal required number of moves and in the next lines print the description of each move, one move per line. To describe a move print two integers. The point from which to remove the stone, and the point to which move the stone.

        "instruction": "Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! \n\nHowever, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a1 = 0, an = l).\n\nValery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, aj - ai = d). \n\nUnder the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. \n\nYour task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y.

Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 2 \u2264 l \u2264 109, 1 \u2264 x < y \u2264 l) \u2014 the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 = a1 < a2 < ... < an = l), where ai shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.\n\nOutput\n\nIn the first line print a single non-negative integer v \u2014 the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.\n\nIn the second line print v space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pv (0 \u2264 pi \u2264 l).

Not any kind of crossword, but a 1D crossword! You are given m words and a string of length n. You are also given an array p, which designates how much each word is worth \u2014 the i-th word is worth pi points. Whenever you find one of the m words in the string, you are given the corresponding number of points. Each position in the crossword can be used at most x times. A certain word can be counted at different places, but you cannot count the same appearance of a word multiple times. If a word is a substring of another word, you can count them both (presuming you haven\u2019t used the positions more than x times).\n\nIn order to solve the puzzle, you need to tell Sanz what\u2019s the maximum achievable number of points in the crossword.

Read the input: The length of the crossword `n`, the crossword string `s`, the number of words `m`, the words and their corresponding points, and the maximum number of times a position in the crossword can be used `x`.\n2. Create a graph with the following nodes: `src` (source), `sink` (sink), and nodes representing each position in the crossword string `s`.\n3. Add edges to the graph: For each word, add edges from each position in the crossword string `s` that matches the word to the corresponding position plus the word's length plus one. The capacity of these edges is set to 1, and the cost is set to the negative of the word's point value.\n4. Add edges to the graph: For each position in the crossword string `s`, add an edge from the position to the next position. The capacity of these edges is set to infinity, and the cost is set to 0.\n5. Add edges to the graph: Add an edge from the source to the first position in the crossword string `s`. The capacity of this edge is set to `x`, and the cost is set to 0.\n6. Add an edge from the last position in the crossword string `s` to the sink. The capacity of this edge is set to `x`, and the cost is set to 0.\n7. Use the Bellman-Ford algorithm or the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the minimum cost flow from the source to the sink in the graph.\n8.

Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:\n\n  * m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). \n  * Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\n\n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time.

Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:\n\n  * m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account). \n  * Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\n\n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1018) \u2014 the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput one integer \u2014 the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time.

It's full, so nothing happens. \n  * At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain. \n  * At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought.
