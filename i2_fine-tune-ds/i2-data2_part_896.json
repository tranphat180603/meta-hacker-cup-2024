Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. \"Piece of cake\" \u2014 thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100), then follow n lines containing three integers each: the xi coordinate, the yi coordinate and the zi coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body ( - 100 \u2264 xi, yi, zi \u2264 100).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the word \"YES\" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word \"NO\" if it is not.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3\n4 1 7\n-2 4 -1\n1 -5 -3\n\n\nOutput\n\nNO\n\nInput\n\n3\n3 -1 7\n-5 2 -4\n2 -1 -3\n\n\nOutput\n\nYES",

A circulation f is such a collection of non-negative real numbers f_e (e \u2208 E), that for each vertex v \u2208 V the following conservation condition holds:\n\n$$$\u2211_{e \u2208 \\delta^{-}(v)} f_e = \u2211_{e \u2208 \\delta^{+}(v)} f_e$$$\n\nwhere \\delta^{+}(v) is the set of edges that end in the vertex v, and \\delta^{-}(v) is the set of edges that start in the vertex v. In other words, for each vertex the total incoming flow should be equal to the total outcoming flow.\n\nLet a lr-circulation be such a circulation f that for each edge the condition l_e \u2264 f_e \u2264 r_e holds, where l_e and r_e for each edge e \u2208 E are two non-negative real numbers denoting the lower and upper bounds on the value of the circulation on this edge e.\n\nVova can't stop thinking about applications of a new topic. Right now he thinks about the following natural question: let the graph be fixed, and each value l_e and r_e be a linear function of a real variable t:\n\n$$$l_e(t) = a_e t + b_e r_e(t) = c_e t + d_e$$$\n\nNote that t is the same for all edges.\n\nLet t be chosen at random from uniform distribution on a segment [0, 1].

This is done by maintaining a stack of visited vertices and iterating through the graph.

After finding all SCCs, perform another DFS to calculate the height of each vertex in the graph. This is done by maintaining a queue of vertices to visit and their corresponding heights. The height of a vertex is the maximum height of its neighbors plus one.\n4. Initialize the result array f with zeros, which will store the maximum distance from each vertex to a leaf in the resulting tree.\n5. Perform a modified DFS on each SCC to calculate the maximum distance from each vertex to a leaf. This is done by maintaining a deque of pairs (distance, index) to store the maximum distance from each vertex to a leaf. The distance is calculated as the maximum distance from the current vertex to a leaf in the current SCC minus the index of the current vertex in the SCC.\n6. After calculating the maximum distance from each vertex to a leaf in each SCC, perform another modified DFS on each SCC to calculate the final result.

There is at most one road between a pair of cities. The cities are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nIt is known that, from the capital (the city with the number 1), you can reach any other city by moving along the roads.\n\nThe President of Berland plans to improve the country's road network. The budget is enough to repair exactly n-1 roads. The President plans to choose a set of n-1 roads such that:\n\n  * it is possible to travel from the capital to any other city along the n-1 chosen roads, \n  * if d_i is the number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city i, moving only along the n-1 chosen roads, then d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_n is minimized (i.e. as minimal as possible). \n\n\n\nIn other words, the set of n-1 roads should preserve the connectivity of the country, and the sum of distances from city 1 to all cities should be minimized (where you can only use the n-1 chosen roads).\n\nThe president instructed the ministry to prepare k possible options to choose n-1 roads so that both conditions above are met.\n\nWrite a program that will find k possible ways to choose roads for repair. If there are fewer than k ways, then the program should output all possible valid ways to choose roads.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains integers n, m and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u22c510^5, n-1 \u2264 m \u2264 2\u22c510^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2\u22c510^5), where n is the number of cities in the country, m is the number of roads and k is the number of options to choose a set of roads for repair. It is guaranteed that m \u22c5 k \u2264 10^6.\n\nThe following m lines describe the roads, one road per line. Each line contains two integers a_i, b_i (1 \u2264 a_i, b_i \u2264 n, a_i \u2260 b_i) \u2014 the numbers of the cities that the i-th road connects. There is at most one road between a pair of cities. The given set of roads is such that you can reach any city from the capital.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 k) \u2014 the number of ways to choose a set of roads for repair. Recall that you need to find k different options; if there are fewer than k of them, then you need to find all possible different valid options.\n\nIn the following t lines, print the options, one per line. Print an option as a string of m characters where the j-th character is equal to '1' if the j-th road is included in the option, and is equal to '0' if the road is not included. The roads should be numbered according to their order in the input. The options can be printed in any order. All the t lines should be different.\n\nSince it is guaranteed that m \u22c5 k \u2264 10^6, the total length of all the t lines will not exceed 10^6.\n\nIf there are several answers, output any of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4 4 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 4\n4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n1110\n1011\n\n\nInput\n\n4 6 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 4\n4 3\n2 4\n1 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n101001\n\n\nInput\n\n5 6 2\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 4\n3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n111100\n110110",

This is why Melon Ask, the famous inventor, decided to create a rain protection mechanism for convertibles.\n\nThe workplace of the mechanism is a part of plane just above the driver. Its functional part consists of two rails with sliding endpoints of a piece of stretching rope. For the sake of simplicity we can consider this as a pair of parallel segments in a plane with the rope segment, whose endpoints we are free to choose as any points on these rails segments.\n\n<image>\n\nThe algorithmic part of the mechanism detects each particular raindrop and predicts when and where it reaches the plane. At this exact moment the rope segment must contain the raindrop point (so the rope adsorbs the raindrop).\n\nYou are given the initial position of the rope endpoints and all information about raindrops. You are to choose the minimal possible speed v of the endpoints sliding (both endpoints can slide in any direction along their segments independently of each other) in such a way that it is possible to catch all raindrops moving both endpoints with speed not greater than v, or find out that it's impossible no matter how high the speed is.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, w and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1\u2264 w, h \u2264 10^3), meaning that there are n raindrops, and two rails are represented as segments connecting (0, 0) and (w, 0) and connecting (0, h) and (w, h).\n\nThe second line contains two integers e_1 and e_2, meaning that the initial (that is, at the moment t = 0) positions of the endpoints are (e_1, 0) and (e_2, h) (0\u2264 e_1, e_2\u2264 w).\n\nThe i-th of the following n lines contains three integers t_i, x_i and y_i (1\u2264 t_i\u2264 10^5, 0\u2264 x_i \u2264 w, 0 < y_i < h) meaning that the i-th raindrop touches the plane at the point (x_i, y_i) at the time moment t_i. It is guaranteed that t_i \u2264 t_{i+1} for all valid i.\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is impossible to catch all raindrops, print -1.\n\nOtherwise, print the least possible maximum speed of the rope endpoints for which it is possible to catch them all. Your answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{-4}.\n\nFormally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b.

        "instruction": "Recently Lynyrd and Skynyrd went to a shop where Lynyrd bought a permutation p of length n, and Skynyrd bought an array a of length m, consisting of integers from 1 to n. \n\nLynyrd and Skynyrd became bored, so they asked you q queries, each of which has the following form: \"does the subsegment of a from the l-th to the r-th positions, inclusive, have a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of p?\" Please answer the queries.\n\nA permutation of length n is a sequence of n integers such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in it.\n\nA cyclic shift of a permutation (p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_n) is a permutation (p_i, p_{i + 1}, \u2026, p_{n}, p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_{i - 1}) for some i from 1 to n. For example, a permutation (2, 1, 3) has three distinct cyclic shifts: (2, 1, 3), (1, 3, 2), (3, 2, 1).\n\nA subsequence of a subsegment of array a from the l-th to the r-th positions, inclusive, is a sequence a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \u2026, a_{i_k} for some i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that l \u2264 i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k \u2264 r.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, q (1 \u2264 n, m, q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the length of the permutation p, the length of the array a and the number of queries.\n\nThe next line contains n integers from 1 to n, where the i-th of them is the i-th element of the permutation. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.\n\nThe next line contains m integers from 1 to n, the i-th of them is the i-th element of the array a.\n\nThe next q lines describe queries. The i-th of these lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (1 \u2264 l_i \u2264 r_i \u2264 m), meaning that the i-th query is about the subsegment of the array from the l_i-th to the r_i-th positions, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single string of length q, consisting of 0 and 1, the digit on the i-th positions should be 1, if the subsegment of array a from the l_i-th to the r_i-th positions, inclusive, contains a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of p, and 0 otherwise.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3 6 3\n2 1 3\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n1 5\n2 6\n3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n110\n\n\nInput\n\n2 4 3\n2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n010\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example the segment from the 1-st to the 5-th positions is 1, 2, 3, 1, 2. There is a subsequence 1, 3, 2 that is a cyclic shift of the permutation. The subsegment from the 2-nd to the 6-th positions also contains a subsequence 2, 1, 3 that is equal to the permutation. The subsegment from the 3-rd to the 5-th positions is 3, 1, 2, there is only one subsequence of length 3 (3, 1, 2), but it is not a cyclic shift of the permutation.\n\nIn the second example the possible cyclic shifts are 1, 2 and 2, 1. The subsegment from the 1-st to the 2-nd positions is 1, 1, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation. The subsegment from the 2-nd to the 3-rd positions is 1, 2, it coincides with the permutation. The subsegment from the 3 to the 4 positions is 2, 2, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation.",

        "instruction": "Recently Lynyrd and Skynyrd went to a shop where Lynyrd bought a permutation p of length n, and Skynyrd bought an array a of length m, consisting of integers from 1 to n. \n\nLynyrd and Skynyrd became bored, so they asked you q queries, each of which has the following form: \"does the subsegment of a from the l-th to the r-th positions, inclusive, have a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of p?\" Please answer the queries.\n\nA permutation of length n is a sequence of n integers such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in it.\n\nA cyclic shift of a permutation (p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_n) is a permutation (p_i, p_{i + 1}, \u2026, p_{n}, p_1, p_2, \u2026, p_{i - 1}) for some i from 1 to n. For example, a permutation (2, 1, 3) has three distinct cyclic shifts: (2, 1, 3), (1, 3, 2), (3, 2, 1).\n\nA subsequence of a subsegment of array a from the l-th to the r-th positions, inclusive, is a sequence a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \u2026, a_{i_k} for some i_1, i_2, \u2026, i_k such that l \u2264 i_1 < i_2 < \u2026 < i_k \u2264 r.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, q (1 \u2264 n, m, q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the length of the permutation p, the length of the array a and the number of queries.\n\nThe next line contains n integers from 1 to n, where the i-th of them is the i-th element of the permutation. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once.\n\nThe next line contains m integers from 1 to n, the i-th of them is the i-th element of the array a.\n\nThe next q lines describe queries. The i-th of these lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (1 \u2264 l_i \u2264 r_i \u2264 m), meaning that the i-th query is about the subsegment of the array from the l_i-th to the r_i-th positions, inclusive.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single string of length q, consisting of 0 and 1, the digit on the i-th positions should be 1, if the subsegment of array a from the l_i-th to the r_i-th positions, inclusive, contains a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of p, and 0 otherwise.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3 6 3\n2 1 3\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n1 5\n2 6\n3 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n110\n\n\nInput\n\n2 4 3\n2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n010\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example the segment from the 1-st to the 5-th positions is 1, 2, 3, 1, 2. There is a subsequence 1, 3, 2 that is a cyclic shift of the permutation. The subsegment from the 2-nd to the 6-th positions also contains a subsequence 2, 1, 3 that is equal to the permutation. The subsegment from the 3-rd to the 5-th positions is 3, 1, 2, there is only one subsequence of length 3 (3, 1, 2), but it is not a cyclic shift of the permutation.\n\nIn the second example the possible cyclic shifts are 1, 2 and 2, 1. The subsegment from the 1-st to the 2-nd positions is 1, 1, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation. The subsegment from the 2-nd to the 3-rd positions is 1, 2, it coincides with the permutation. The subsegment from the 3 to the 4 positions is 2, 2, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation.",
