Residents of Tomsk while away the time sitting in warm apartments, inventing a lot of different games. One of such games is 'Colored Jenga'.\n\nThis game requires wooden blocks of three colors: red, green and blue. A tower of n levels is made from them. Each level consists of three wooden blocks. The blocks in each level can be of arbitrary colors, but they are always located close and parallel to each other. An example of such a tower is shown in the figure.\n\n<image>\n\nThe game is played by exactly one person. Every minute a player throws a special dice which has six sides. Two sides of the dice are green, two are blue, one is red and one is black. The dice shows each side equiprobably.\n\nIf the dice shows red, green or blue, the player must take any block of this color out of the tower at this minute so that the tower doesn't fall. If this is not possible, the player waits until the end of the minute, without touching the tower. He also has to wait until the end of the minute without touching the tower if the dice shows the black side. It is not allowed to take blocks from the top level of the tower (whether it is completed or not).\n\nOnce a player got a block out, he must put it on the top of the tower so as to form a new level or finish the upper level consisting of previously placed blocks. The newly constructed levels should have all the same properties as the initial levels. If the upper level is not completed, starting the new level is prohibited.\n\nFor the tower not to fall, in each of the levels except for the top, there should be at least one block. Moreover, if at some of these levels there is exactly one block left and this block is not the middle block, the tower falls.\n\nThe game ends at the moment when there is no block in the tower that you can take out so that the tower doesn't fall.\n\nHere is a wonderful game invented by the residents of the city of Tomsk. I wonder for how many minutes can the game last if the player acts optimally well? If a player acts optimally well, then at any moment he tries to choose the block he takes out so as to minimize the expected number of the game duration.\n\nYour task is to write a program that determines the expected number of the desired amount of minutes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains the only integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 6) \u2014 the number of levels in the tower.\n\nThen n lines follow, describing the levels of the tower from the bottom to the top (the first line is the top of the tower). Each level is described by three characters, the first and the third of them set the border blocks of the level and the second one is the middle block. The character that describes the block has one of the following values 'R' (a red block), 'G' (a green block) and 'B' (a blue block).\n\nOutput\n\nIn the only line of the output print the sought mathematical expectation value. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n6\nRGB\nGRG\nBBB\nGGR\nBRG\nBRB\n\n\nOutput\n\n17.119213696601992",

Residents of Tomsk while away the time sitting in warm apartments, inventing a lot of different games. One of such games is 'Colored Jenga'.\n\nThis game requires wooden blocks of three colors: red, green and blue. A tower of n levels is made from them. Each level consists of three wooden blocks. The blocks in each level can be of arbitrary colors, but they are always located close and parallel to each other. An example of such a tower is shown in the figure.\n\n<image>\n\nThe game is played by exactly one person. Every minute a player throws a special dice which has six sides. Two sides of the dice are green, two are blue, one is red and one is black. The dice shows each side equiprobably.\n\nIf the dice shows red, green or blue, the player must take any block of this color out of the tower at this minute so that the tower doesn't fall. If this is not possible, the player waits until the end of the minute, without touching the tower. He also has to wait until the end of the minute without touching the tower if the dice shows the black side. It is not allowed to take blocks from the top level of the tower (whether it is completed or not).\n\nOnce a player got a block out, he must put it on the top of the tower so as to form a new level or finish the upper level consisting of previously placed blocks. The newly constructed levels should have all the same properties as the initial levels. If the upper level is not completed, starting the new level is prohibited.\n\nFor the tower not to fall, in each of the levels except for the top, there should be at least one block. Moreover, if at some of these levels there is exactly one block left and this block is not the middle block, the tower falls.\n\nThe game ends at the moment when there is no block in the tower that you can take out so that the tower doesn't fall.\n\nHere is a wonderful game invented by the residents of the city of Tomsk. I wonder for how many minutes can the game last if the player acts optimally well? If a player acts optimally well, then at any moment he tries to choose the block he takes out so as to minimize the expected number of the game duration.\n\nYour task is to write a program that determines the expected number of the desired amount of minutes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains the only integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 6) \u2014 the number of levels in the tower.\n\nThen n lines follow, describing the levels of the tower from the bottom to the top (the first line is the top of the tower). Each level is described by three characters, the first and the third of them set the border blocks of the level and the second one is the middle block. The character that describes the block has one of the following values 'R' (a red block), 'G' (a green block) and 'B' (a blue block).\n\nOutput\n\nIn the only line of the output print the sought mathematical expectation value. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n6\nRGB\nGRG\nBBB\nGGR\nBRG\nBRB\n\n\nOutput\n\n17.119213696601992",

Initialize a State object to represent the initial state of the tower. The State object contains a 3x3x3 count array to store the number of blocks of each color at each level, a 3-element have array to store the number of blocks of each color that can be taken out, and a 3-element top array to store the colors of the top three blocks.\n3. Define a DP function to calculate the expected number of minutes until the game ends. The DP function takes a State object as input and returns the expected number of minutes.\n4. In the DP function, first check if the current state has been visited before. If it has, return the stored result.\n5. Initialize the expected number of minutes (e) to 0 and the number of self-loops (self) to 0.\n6. For each possible color (red, green, and blue) that can be dropped, try to drop it and calculate the expected number of minutes. If dropping the color results in a valid state, update the expected number of minutes and the number of self-loops accordingly.\n7. If the current state has no self-loops, return the expected number of minutes.\n8. Calculate the probability of each color being dropped and update the expected number of minutes accordingly.\n9.

Initialize the graph and variables: The code starts by initializing the graph data structures (head, nxt, v, color) and variables (vis, n, m, ans, step, cnt) to their default values.\n2. Read the input: The code reads the number of vertices (n) and edges (m) from the input, and then reads the description of each edge (ui, vi, ci) from the input.\n3. Add edges to the graph: The code adds each edge to the graph using the add_edge function, which updates the head, nxt, v, and color arrays accordingly.\n4. Perform DFS to find connected components: The code performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to find connected components. The DFS function takes a vertex x, a color ju, and a color c as input, and returns 1 if the DFS is successful and 0 otherwise.\n5. Update the judge and step arrays: The code updates the judge and step arrays based on the result of the DFS. If the DFS is successful, the code adds the visited vertices to the judge array and updates the step array accordingly.\n6. Calculate the minimum number of moves: The code calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the colors of all edges equal by calling the deal function twice, once for each color.\n7. Output the result: The code outputs the minimum number of moves required and the sequence of vertices to be used to achieve the goal.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int maxn = 200005;\nint head[maxn], nxt[maxn], v[maxn], color[maxn];\nint vis[maxn], n, m;\nvector<int> judge[2];\nvector<int> step[2];\nint ans[2];\nint cnt;\nvoid init() {\n  // Initialize the graph and variables\n  cnt = 0;\n  memset(ans, 0, sizeof(0));\n  memset(head, -1, sizeof(head));\n  memset(nxt, -1, sizeof(nxt));\n}\nvoid add_edge(int x, int y, int c) {\n  // Add an edge to the graph\n  nxt[cnt] = head[x];\n  head[x] = cnt;\n  v[cnt] = y;\n  color[cnt] = c;\n  cnt++;\n}\nint dfs(int x, int ju, int c) {\n  // Perform DFS to find connected components\n  vis[x] = ju;\n  judge[ju].push_back(x);\n  for (int i = head[x]; i!= -1; i = nxt[i]) {\n    if (vis[v[i]]!= -1) {\n      // If the edge is already visited, check if the colors match\n      if ((vis[x] ^ vis[v[i]])!= (c ^ color[i])) return 0;\n      continue;\n    }\n    // Recursively visit the neighboring vertex\n    int tmp = dfs(v[i], c ^ color[i] ^ vis[x], c);\n    if (tmp == 0) return 0;\n  }\n  return 1;\n}\nint deal(int color) {\n  // Calculate the minimum number of moves required\n  memset(vis, -1, sizeof(vis));\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    if (vis[i] == -1) {\n      // Perform DFS to find connected components\n      judge[0].clear();\n      judge[1].clear();\n      int tmp = dfs(i, 0, color);\n      if (tmp == 0) return 10000000;\n      // Update the step array based on the result of the DFS\n      if (judge[0].size() < judge[1].size()) {\n        ans[color] += judge[0].size();\n        step[color].insert(step[color].end(), judge[0].begin(), judge[0].end());\n      } else {\n        ans[color] += judge[1].size();\n        step[color].insert(step[color].end(), judge[1].begin(), judge[1].end());\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return ans[color];\n}\nint main() {\n  init();\n  // Read the input\n  scanf(\"%d%d\", &n, &m);\n  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\n    int a, b;\n    char c;\n    scanf(\"%d %d %c\", &a, &b, &c);\n    // Add edges to the graph\n    if (c == 'R') {\n      add_edge(a, b, 1);\n      add_edge(b, a, 1);\n    } else {\n      add_edge(a, b, 0);\n      add_edge(b, a, 0);\n    }\n  }\n  // Calculate the minimum number of moves required\n  int tmp1 = deal(0);\n  int tmp2 = deal(1);\n  if (tmp1 == 10000000 && tmp2 == 10000000) {\n    // If it's impossible to make the colors equal, output -1\n    printf(\"-1\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  // Output the result\n  if (tmp1 < tmp2) {\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans[0]);\n    for (int i = 0; i < step[0].size(); i++) printf(\"%d \", step[0][i]);\n  } else {\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans[1]);\n    for (int i = 0; i < step[1].size(); i++) printf(\"%d \", step[1][i]);\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

The following m lines describe the edges, each containing two vertices and a color (red or blue).\n2. Create adjacency lists for the graph: For each edge, add the corresponding vertices to the adjacency lists (gedge and bedge) based on their colors.\n3.

Assign colors to vertices: Based on the DFS results, assign colors (0 or 1) to each vertex.\n5. Check if the colors of all edges can be made equal: Iterate through each vertex and its adjacent vertices. If the colors of an edge are different, or if the colors of an edge are the same but the edge is in the wrong list (gedge or bedge), set a flag to indicate that the colors cannot be made equal.\n6. If the colors cannot be made equal, output -1 and exit.\n7.

Output the minimum number of moves and the corresponding vertices: If the minimum number of moves is less than the current minimum, update the minimum and store the corresponding vertices in the an vector.\n9.

Each student's essay was dedicated to one of the students of class, to his/her best friend. Note that student b's best friend is not necessarily student a, if a's best friend is b.\n\nAnd now the teacher leads the whole class to the museum of the history of sports programming. Exciting stories of legendary heroes await the students: tourist, Petr, tomek, SnapDragon \u2014 that's who they will hear about!\n\nThe teacher decided to divide students into pairs so that each pair consisted of a student and his best friend. She may not be able to split all the students into pairs, it's not a problem \u2014 she wants to pick out the maximum number of such pairs. If there is more than one variant of doing so, she wants to pick out the pairs so that there were as much boy-girl pairs as possible. Of course, each student must not be included in more than one pair.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 105), n is the number of students per class. Next, n lines contain information about the students, one per line. Each line contains two integers fi, si (1 \u2264 fi \u2264 n, fi \u2260 i, 1 \u2264 si \u2264 2), where fi is the number of i-th student's best friend and si denotes the i-th pupil's sex (si = 1 for a boy and si = 2 for a girl).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint on the first line two numbers t, e, where t is the maximum number of formed pairs, and e is the maximum number of boy-girl type pairs among them. Then print t lines, each line must contain a pair ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n), they are numbers of pupils in the i-th pair. Print the pairs in any order. Print the numbers in pairs in any order.

Given that restriction, what is the maximum possible total happiness that can be achieved?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input will contain integers N and S (1 \u2264 N \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 S \u2264 105), the number of contestants and the number of slices per pizza, respectively.

If you buy a type 1 pizza, the total happiness will be 3\u00b75 + 4\u00b76 + 5\u00b79 = 84, and if you buy a type 2 pizza, the total happiness will be 3\u00b77 + 4\u00b77 + 5\u00b75 = 74.",

If the city belongs to Byteland, c_i equals to 'B'. If the city belongs to Berland, c_i equals to \u00abR\u00bb. If the city is disputed, c_i equals to 'P'. \n\nAll cities have distinct coordinates. Guaranteed, that the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the minimal total length of such set of cables, that if we delete all Berland cities (c_i='R'), it will be possible to find a way from any remaining city to any other remaining city, moving only by cables. Similarly, if we delete all Byteland cities (c_i='B'), it will be possible to find a way from any remaining city to any other remaining city, moving only by cables.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4\n-5 R\n0 P\n3 P\n7 B\n\n\nOutput\n\n12\n\n\nInput\n\n5\n10 R\n14 B\n16 B\n21 R\n32 R\n\n\nOutput\n\n24\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, you should connect the first city with the second, the second with the third, and the third with the fourth. The total length of the cables will be 5 + 3 + 4 = 12.\n\nIn the second example there are no disputed cities, so you need to connect all the neighboring cities of Byteland and all the neighboring cities of Berland. The cities of Berland have coordinates 10, 21, 32, so to connect them you need two cables of length 11 and 11. The cities of Byteland have coordinates 14 and 16, so to connect them you need one cable of length 2. Thus, the total length of all cables is 11 + 11 + 2 = 24.",

She offered the students a string consisting of n small Latin letters; the task was to learn the way the letters that the string contains are written. However, as Gerald is too lazy, he has no desire whatsoever to learn those letters. That's why he decided to lose some part of the string (not necessarily a connected part). The lost part can consist of any number of segments of any length, at any distance from each other. However, Gerald knows that if he loses more than k characters, it will be very suspicious. \n\nFind the least number of distinct characters that can remain in the string after no more than k characters are deleted.

The i-th line contains m integers a_{i1}, a_{i2}, ..., a_{im} ~ (0 \u2264 a_{ij} \u2264 10^9).\n\nThe following line contains two integers r and c (1 \u2264 r \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 m) \u2014 the index of row and the index of column where the chip is now.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the expected value of Vasya's final score in the format described in the problem statement.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n1 4\n1 1 2 1\n1 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n2 3\n1 5 7\n2 3 1\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n665496238\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, Vasya will move his chip exactly once. The expected value of the final score is equal to (1^2 + 2^2+ 1^2)/(3) = 2.",

Read the matrix a, where each row is represented as a list of integers.\n3. Read the starting position of the chip, represented as row r and column c.\n4. Create an array inv to store the modular multiplicative inverses of numbers from 2 to MX (a large number).\n5. Sort the indices of the matrix elements based on their values.\n6. Initialize variables to keep track of the sum of x and y coordinates, the sum of squares of x and y coordinates, and the count of elements with the same value as the current element.\n7. Iterate through the sorted indices, and for each group of elements with the same value:\n   a. Calculate the sum of distances from the current element to all other elements with the same value.\n   b. If the current element is the starting position of the chip, mark it as done and break the loop.\n   c. Update the sum of x and y coordinates, the sum of squares of x and y coordinates, and the count of elements.\n8. Calculate the expected value of the final score by summing up the distances for all elements.\n9.
