        "instruction": "So you decided to hold a contest on Codeforces. You prepared the problems: statements, solutions, checkers, validators, tests... Suddenly, your coordinator asks you to change all your tests to multiple testcases in the easiest problem!\n\nInitially, each test in that problem is just an array. The maximum size of an array is k. For simplicity, the contents of arrays don't matter. You have n tests \u2014 the i-th test is an array of size m_i (1 \u2264 m_i \u2264 k).\n\nYour coordinator asks you to distribute all of your arrays into multiple testcases. Each testcase can include multiple arrays. However, each testcase should include no more than c_1 arrays of size greater than or equal to 1 (\u2265 1), no more than c_2 arrays of size greater than or equal to 2, ..., no more than c_k arrays of size greater than or equal to k. Also, c_1 \u2265 c_2 \u2265 ... \u2265 c_k.\n\nSo now your goal is to create the new testcases in such a way that: \n\n  * each of the initial arrays appears in exactly one testcase; \n  * for each testcase the given conditions hold; \n  * the number of testcases is minimum possible. \n\n\n\nPrint the minimum possible number of testcases you can achieve and the sizes of arrays included in each testcase.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of initial tests and the limit for the size of each array.\n\nThe second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 \u2264 m_i \u2264 k) \u2014 the sizes of the arrays in the original tests.\n\nThe third line contains k integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_k (n \u2265 c_1 \u2265 c_2 \u2265 ... \u2265 c_k \u2265 1); c_i is the maximum number of arrays of size greater than or equal to i you can have in a single testcase.\n\nOutput\n\nIn the first line print a single integer ans (1 \u2264 ans \u2264 n) \u2014 the minimum number of testcases you can achieve.\n\nEach of the next ans lines should contain the description of a testcase in the following format:\n\nt a_1 a_2 ... a_{t} (1 \u2264 t\u2264 n) \u2014 the testcase includes t arrays, a_i is the size of the i-th array in that testcase.\n\nEach of the initial arrays should appear in exactly one testcase. In particular, it implies that the sum of t over all ans testcases should be equal to n.\n\nNote that the answer always exists due to c_k \u2265 1 (and therefore c_1 \u2265 1).\n\nIf there are multiple answers, you can output any one of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4 3\n1 2 2 3\n4 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n1 2\n2 1 3\n1 2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6 10\n5 8 1 10 8 7\n6 6 4 4 3 2 2 2 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n3 8 5 7\n3 10 8 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n5 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n5\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example there is no way to distribute the tests into less than 3 testcases. The given answer satisfies the conditions: each of the testcases includes no more than 4 arrays of size greater than or equal to 1 and no more than 1 array of sizes greater than or equal to 2 and 3.\n\nNote that there are multiple valid answers for this test. For example, testcases with sizes [[2], [1, 2], [3]] would also be correct.\n\nHowever, testcases with sizes [[1, 2], [2, 3]] would be incorrect because there are 2 arrays of size greater than or equal to 2 in the second testcase.\n\nNote the difference between the third and the fourth examples. You can include up to 5 arrays of size greater than or equal to 1 in the third example, so you can put all arrays into a single testcase. And you can have only up to 1 array in the fourth example. Thus, every array should be included in a separate testcase.",

During the DFS traversal, keep track of the depth of each vertex and the ancestor of each vertex.\n6.

Convert the characters in `a` and `b` to indices in the range `[0, 19]` by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'.\n3. Initialize a `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) data structure with 20 elements, representing the 20 lowercase letters. This data structure will be used to keep track of the connected components in the graph.\n4. Iterate through the characters in `a` and `b`. If the characters at the current positions are different, join the corresponding components in the `DSU` data structure. This effectively groups the positions with the same character together.\n5. Create a graph `g` where each node represents a character, and there is an edge between two nodes if the corresponding characters appear together in the strings. The edge weight is the number of positions where the characters appear together.\n6. Initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `1 << 20`, where each element represents the minimum number of moves required to make the characters at the positions corresponding to the binary representation of the index equal.\n7. Iterate through the possible masks in the `dp` array. For each mask, iterate through the characters and update the `dp` array by considering the edges in the graph. If the current mask and the character form an edge, and the corresponding bit in the mask is not set, update the `dp` array with the minimum number of moves required to make the characters equal.\n8. Calculate the maximum number of characters that can be made equal in a single move, which is the maximum number of bits set in any mask in the `dp` array.\n9.

        "instruction": "You are a paparazzi working in Manhattan.\n\nManhattan has r south-to-north streets, denoted by numbers 1, 2,\u2026, r in order from west to east, and r west-to-east streets, denoted by numbers 1,2,\u2026,r in order from south to north. Each of the r south-to-north streets intersects each of the r west-to-east streets; the intersection between the x-th south-to-north street and the y-th west-to-east street is denoted by (x, y). In order to move from the intersection (x,y) to the intersection (x', y') you need |x-x'|+|y-y'| minutes.\n\nYou know about the presence of n celebrities in the city and you want to take photos of as many of them as possible. More precisely, for each i=1,..., n, you know that the i-th celebrity will be at the intersection (x_i, y_i) in exactly t_i minutes from now (and he will stay there for a very short time, so you may take a photo of him only if at the t_i-th minute from now you are at the intersection (x_i, y_i)). You are very good at your job, so you are able to take photos instantaneously. You know that t_i < t_{i+1} for any i=1,2,\u2026, n-1.\n\nCurrently you are at your office, which is located at the intersection (1, 1). If you plan your working day optimally, what is the maximum number of celebrities you can take a photo of?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two positive integers r, n (1\u2264 r\u2264 500, 1\u2264 n\u2264 100,000) \u2013 the number of south-to-north/west-to-east streets and the number of celebrities.\n\nThen n lines follow, each describing the appearance of a celebrity. The i-th of these lines contains 3 positive integers t_i, x_i, y_i (1\u2264 t_i\u2264 1,000,000, 1\u2264 x_i, y_i\u2264 r) \u2014 denoting that the i-th celebrity will appear at the intersection (x_i, y_i) in t_i minutes from now.\n\nIt is guaranteed that t_i<t_{i+1} for any i=1,2,\u2026, n-1.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer, the maximum number of celebrities you can take a photo of.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n10 1\n11 6 8\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6 9\n1 2 6\n7 5 1\n8 5 5\n10 3 1\n12 4 4\n13 6 2\n17 6 6\n20 1 4\n21 5 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 4\n1 2 1\n5 10 9\n13 8 8\n15 9 9\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n500 10\n69 477 122\n73 186 235\n341 101 145\n372 77 497\n390 117 440\n494 471 37\n522 300 498\n682 149 379\n821 486 359\n855 157 386\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the first testcase: There is only one celebrity in the city, and he will be at intersection (6,8) exactly 11 minutes after the beginning of the working day. Since you are initially at (1,1) and you need |1-6|+|1-8|=5+7=12 minutes to reach (6,8) you cannot take a photo of the celebrity. Thus you cannot get any photo and the answer is 0.\n\nExplanation of the second testcase: One way to take 4 photos (which is the maximum possible) is to take photos of celebrities with indexes 3, 5, 7, 9 (see the image for a visualization of the strategy): \n\n  * To move from the office at (1,1) to the intersection (5,5) you need |1-5|+|1-5|=4+4=8 minutes, so you arrive at minute 8 and you are just in time to take a photo of celebrity 3. \n  * Then, just after you have taken a photo of celebrity 3, you move toward the intersection (4,4). You need |5-4|+|5-4|=1+1=2 minutes to go there, so you arrive at minute 8+2=10 and you wait until minute 12, when celebrity 5 appears. \n  * Then, just after you have taken a photo of celebrity 5, you go to the intersection (6,6). You need |4-6|+|4-6|=2+2=4 minutes to go there, so you arrive at minute 12+4=16 and you wait until minute 17, when celebrity 7 appears. \n  * Then, just after you have taken a photo of celebrity 7, you go to the intersection (5,4). You need |6-5|+|6-4|=1+2=3 minutes to go there, so you arrive at minute 17+3=20 and you wait until minute 21 to take a photo of celebrity 9. \n\n<image>\n\nExplanation of the third testcase: The only way to take 1 photo (which is the maximum possible) is to take a photo of the celebrity with index 1 (since |2-1|+|1-1|=1, you can be at intersection (2,1) after exactly one minute, hence you are just in time to take a photo of celebrity 1).\n\nExplanation of the fourth testcase: One way to take 3 photos (which is the maximum possible) is to take photos of celebrities with indexes 3, 8, 10: \n\n  * To move from the office at (1,1) to the intersection (101,145) you need |1-101|+|1-145|=100+144=244 minutes, so you can manage to be there when the celebrity 3 appears (at minute 341). \n  * Then, just after you have taken a photo of celebrity 3, you move toward the intersection (149,379). You need |101-149|+|145-379|=282 minutes to go there, so you arrive at minute 341+282=623 and you wait until minute 682, when celebrity 8 appears. \n  * Then, just after you have taken a photo of celebrity 8, you go to the intersection (157,386). You need |149-157|+|379-386|=8+7=15 minutes to go there, so you arrive at minute 682+15=697 and you wait until minute 855 to take a photo of celebrity 10. ",

For example, the result of bitwise summing of 0110 and 1101 is 1211 or the sum of 011000 and 011000 is 022000; \n  * after that Mike replaces equal consecutive digits in c by one digit, thus getting d. In the cases above after this operation, 1211 becomes 121 and 022000 becomes 020 (so, d won't have equal consecutive digits). \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Mike lost integer a before he could calculate d himself. Now, to cheer him up, you want to find any binary integer a of length n such that d will be maximum possible as integer.\n\nMaximum possible as integer means that 102 > 21, 012 < 101, 021 = 21 and so on.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of a and b.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains binary integer b of length n.

        "instruction": "Petya loves football very much, especially when his parents aren't home. Each morning he comes to the yard, gathers his friends and they play all day. From time to time they have a break to have some food or do some chores (for example, water the flowers).\n\nThe key in football is to divide into teams fairly before the game begins. There are n boys playing football in the yard (including Petya), each boy's football playing skill is expressed with a non-negative characteristic ai (the larger it is, the better the boy plays). \n\nLet's denote the number of players in the first team as x, the number of players in the second team as y, the individual numbers of boys who play for the first team as pi and the individual numbers of boys who play for the second team as qi. Division n boys into two teams is considered fair if three conditions are fulfilled:\n\n  * Each boy plays for exactly one team (x + y = n). \n  * The sizes of teams differ in no more than one (|x - y| \u2264 1). \n  * The total football playing skills for two teams differ in no more than by the value of skill the best player in the yard has. More formally: <image>\n\n\n\nYour task is to help guys divide into two teams fairly. It is guaranteed that a fair division into two teams always exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains the only integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 105) which represents the number of guys in the yard. The next line contains n positive space-separated integers, ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 104), the i-th number represents the i-th boy's playing skills. \n\nOutput\n\nOn the first line print an integer x \u2014 the number of boys playing for the first team. On the second line print x integers \u2014 the individual numbers of boys playing for the first team. On the third line print an integer y \u2014 the number of boys playing for the second team, on the fourth line print y integers \u2014 the individual numbers of boys playing for the second team.

The Beaver has a lot of acquaintances, some of them are friends with each other, and some of them dislike each other. To make party successful, the Smart Beaver wants to invite only those of his friends who are connected by friendship relations, and not to invite those who dislike each other. Both friendship and dislike are mutual feelings.\n\nMore formally, for each invited person the following conditions should be fulfilled: \n\n  * all his friends should also be invited to the party; \n  * the party shouldn't have any people he dislikes; \n  * all people who are invited to the party should be connected with him by friendship either directly or through a chain of common friends of arbitrary length.

Next m lines describe pairs of people who dislike each other in the same format as the pairs of friends were described.\n\nEach pair of people is mentioned in the input at most once <image>.

Define a function `work` to recursively divide the table into smaller sub-problems and calculate the number of rectangles with exactly k '1's.\n7. In the `work` function, handle the base cases where the rectangle has only one cell or the number of '1's is less than k.\n8. If the rectangle has more than one cell, divide it into two smaller rectangles along the horizontal or vertical axis, depending on which dimension is larger.\n9. For each smaller rectangle, calculate the number of rectangles with exactly k '1's using the `calc` function and the `f` array to store the dynamic programming state.\n10. Update the `ans` variable with the total count of rectangles with exactly k '1's.\n11. Finally, print the value of `ans` as the output.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int N = 2505;\nint n, m, K;\nint sum[N][N];\nchar mapp[N][N];\n\n// Function to calculate the number of '1's in a rectangle\ninline int calc(int x1, int x2, int Yy1, int Yy2) {\n  // Calculate the number of '1's in the rectangle using the cumulative sum array\n  return sum[x2][Yy2] - sum[x1 - 1][Yy2] - sum[x2][Yy1 - 1] + sum[x1 - 1][Yy1 - 1];\n}\n\n// Variable to store the total count of rectangles with exactly k '1's\nlong long ans;\n\n// Dynamic programming array to store the state of the problem\nint f[2][10];\n\n// Function to recursively divide the table into smaller sub-problems and calculate the number of rectangles with exactly k '1's\nvoid work(int x1, int x2, int Yy1, int Yy2) {\n  // Base case: If the rectangle has only one cell or the number of '1's is less than k, return\n  if (x1 > x2 || Yy1 > Yy2 || calc(x1, x2, Yy1, Yy2) < K) return;\n\n  // Base case: If the rectangle has only one cell, check if the number of '1's is equal to k\n  if (x1 == x2 && Yy1 == Yy2) {\n    // If the number of '1's is equal to k, increment the count\n    ans += (calc(x1, x2, Yy1, Yy2) == K);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Divide the rectangle into two smaller rectangles along the horizontal or vertical axis\n  int mid;\n  if (x2 - x1 >= Yy2 - Yy1) {\n    // Divide along the horizontal axis\n    mid = (x1 + x2) >> 1;\n    work(x1, mid, Yy1, Yy2);\n    work(mid + 1, x2, Yy1, Yy2);\n    // Calculate the number of rectangles with exactly k '1's using dynamic programming\n    for (int i = Yy1; i <= Yy2; ++i) {\n      for (int k = 0; k <= K; ++k) f[0][k] = x1, f[1][k] = x2;\n      for (int j = i; j <= Yy2; ++j) {\n        for (int k = 0; k <= K; ++k) {\n          // Update the dynamic programming state\n          while (calc(f[0][k], mid, i, j) > k && f[0][k] <= mid) ++f[0][k];\n          while (calc(mid + 1, f[1][k], i, j) > k && f[1][k] > mid) --f[1][k];\n        }\n        // Calculate the number of rectangles with exactly k '1's\n        for (int k = 0; k <= K; ++k)\n          ans += 1ll * abs(f[0][k] - ((k == 0)?

Initialize a 2D array's' to store the table, where each cell contains either '0' or '1'.\n3. Initialize a 2D array'sum' to store the cumulative sum of '1's in each sub-table.\n4. Define a function 'calc' to calculate the number of '1's in a rectangle defined by the top-left and bottom-right corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).\n5. Define a recursive function'solve' to calculate the number of rectangles with exactly K '1's. The function takes the top-left and bottom-right corners of the current sub-table and the direction of the current split (horver = 1 for horizontal split, 0 for vertical split).\n6. In the'solve' function, handle the base case where the sub-table has only one cell.\n7. If the current split is horizontal, recursively call'solve' for the left and right sub-tables, and then iterate over the rows of the current sub-table to calculate the number of rectangles with exactly K '1's.\n8. If the current split is vertical, recursively call'solve' for the top and bottom sub-tables, and then iterate over the columns of the current sub-table to calculate the number of rectangles with exactly K '1's.\n9. In both cases, use the 'p1' and 'p2' arrays to store the positions of the '1's in the current sub-table, and calculate the number of rectangles with exactly K '1's by iterating over the positions of the '1's.\n10.

If more than `n/2` friends need to lie down, break the loop as it's not possible to fit all friends within `curh`.\n7. Sort the differences between the widths and heights of the friends' rectangles that can fit within `curh` (i.e., `diff`).\n8. Iterate over the sorted differences and add them to `curw` until `swaps` reaches `n/2` or all differences have been added.\n9. If `swaps` is less than or equal to `n/2`, update `result` with the minimum of its current value and the product of `curh` and `curw`.\n10.

        "instruction": "Let's define the permutation of length n as an array p = [p1, p2, ..., pn] consisting of n distinct integers from range from 1 to n. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value p1, value 2 into the value p2 and so on.\n\nKyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of p as a collection of cycles forming p. For example, permutation p = [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. \n\nPermutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] is (421)(5)(63).\n\nNow, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] will become [4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 3].\n\nKyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length n that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list. Kyoya wishes to reproduce the list and he needs your help. Given the integers n and k, print the permutation that was k-th on Kyoya's list.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line will contain two integers n, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 min{1018, l} where l is the length of the Kyoya's list).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n space-separated integers, representing the permutation that is the answer for the question. \n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 3 2 4\n\n\nInput\n\n10 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nNote\n\nThe standard cycle representation is (1)(32)(4), which after removing parenthesis gives us the original permutation. The first permutation on the list would be [1, 2, 3, 4], while the second permutation would be [1, 2, 4, 3].",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input values of n and k, where n is the length of the permutation and k is the position of the permutation in the list.\n2. Calculate the Fibonacci numbers up to n using dynamic programming, as the number of permutations that do not change after applying the operation is related to Fibonacci numbers.\n3. Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers and the permutation elements simultaneously. For each element, check if the current Fibonacci number is less than k. If it is, print the current element and the next element, and subtract the current Fibonacci number from k. This is because we are essentially building the permutation by choosing the next element to be the one that is larger than the current element.\n4. If the current Fibonacci number is not less than k, simply print the current element.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all elements of the permutation have been printed.\n6. Print a newline character at the end to complete the output.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n  // Read the input values of n and k\n  int n;\n  long long k;\n  scanf(\"%d%I64d\", &n, &k);\n\n  // Initialize the Fibonacci array with the first two Fibonacci numbers\n  fib[1] = 1;\n  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n    // Calculate each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding ones\n    fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];\n  }\n\n  // Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers and the permutation elements\n  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n    // Check if the current Fibonacci number is less than k\n    if (fib[n - i + 1] < k) {\n      // If it is, print the current element and the next element, and subtract the current Fibonacci number from k\n      printf(\"%d %d \", i + 1, i);\n      k -= fib[n - i + 1];\n      // Increment i to skip the next element in the next iteration\n      i++;\n    } else {\n      // If the current Fibonacci number is not less than k, simply print the current element\n      printf(\"%d \", i);\n    }\n  }\n  // Print a newline character at the end to complete the output\n  puts(\"\");\n  return 0;\n}\n```",
