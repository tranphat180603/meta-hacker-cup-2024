Formally: there exists t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 k) such that b_1=c_1, b_2=c_2, ..., b_{t-1}=c_{t-1} and at the same time b_t<c_t. For example:\n\n  * [10, 20, 20] lexicographically less than [10, 21, 1], \n  * [7, 99, 99] is lexicographically less than [10, 21, 1], \n  * [10, 21, 0] is lexicographically less than [10, 21, 1]. \n\n\n\nYou are given a sequence of a=[a_1,a_2,...,a_n] and m requests, each consisting of two numbers k_j and pos_j (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 pos_j \u2264 k_j). For each query, print the value that is in the index pos_j of the optimal subsequence of the given sequence a for k=k_j.\n\nFor example, if n=4, a=[10,20,30,20], k_j=2, then the optimal subsequence is [20,30] \u2014 it is the minimum lexicographically among all subsequences of length 2 with the maximum total sum of items. Thus, the answer to the request k_j=2, pos_j=1 is the number 20, and the answer to the request k_j=2, pos_j=2 is the number 30.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the sequence a.\n\nThe second line contains elements of the sequence a: integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9).\n\nThe third line contains an integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of requests.\n\nThe following m lines contain pairs of integers k_j and pos_j (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 pos_j \u2264 k_j) \u2014 the requests.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint m integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_m (1 \u2264 r_j \u2264 10^9) one per line: answers to the requests in the order they appear in the input. The value of r_j should be equal to the value contained in the position pos_j of the optimal subsequence for k=k_j.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n10 20 10\n6\n1 1\n2 1\n2 2\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n20\n10\n20\n10\n20\n10\n\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n1 2 1 3 1 2 1\n9\n2 1\n2 2\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n1 1\n7 1\n7 7\n7 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n3\n2\n3\n2\n3\n1\n1\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, for a=[10,20,10] the optimal subsequences are: \n\n  * for k=1: [20], \n  * for k=2: [10,20], \n  * for k=3: [10,20,10].

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input: The first step is to read the number of vertices `n` and the coordinates of each vertex `A_i = (x_i, y_i)`. Then, read the edges of the tree, where each edge is represented by two vertices `s` and `f`.\n2. Preprocess the data: Create a vector `v` to store the adjacency list of the tree, where `v[i]` contains the indices of the vertices adjacent to vertex `i`. Also, create a vector `way` to store the path from vertex `i` to vertex `j` such that the line segment `A_i A_j` does not intersect with any other line segment in the tree.\n3. Define helper functions: Define three helper functions `scal`, `mul`, and `half` to calculate the scalar product, cross product, and half-plane classification of two vectors, respectively.\n4. Perform DFS: Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree to calculate the number of good partitions. The DFS function `dfs` takes a vertex `p` as input and returns a vector of vertices that form a subtree rooted at `p`.\n5. Calculate the number of good partitions: In the DFS function, calculate the number of good partitions by iterating over all pairs of vertices `i` and `j` such that the line segment `A_i A_j` does not intersect with any other line segment in the tree. For each pair, calculate the number of good partitions by iterating over all vertices `k` in the subtree rooted at `i` and `j`.\n6.

        "instruction": "Gildong is playing with his dog, Badugi. They're at a park that has n intersections and n-1 bidirectional roads, each 1 meter in length and connecting two intersections with each other. The intersections are numbered from 1 to n, and for every a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n), it is possible to get to the b-th intersection from the a-th intersection using some set of roads.\n\nGildong has put one snack at every intersection of the park. Now Gildong will give Badugi a mission to eat all of the snacks. Badugi starts at the 1-st intersection, and he will move by the following rules:\n\n  * Badugi looks for snacks that are as close to him as possible. Here, the distance is the length of the shortest path from Badugi's current location to the intersection with the snack. However, Badugi's sense of smell is limited to k meters, so he can only find snacks that are less than or equal to k meters away from himself. If he cannot find any such snack, he fails the mission. \n  * Among all the snacks that Badugi can smell from his current location, he chooses a snack that minimizes the distance he needs to travel from his current intersection. If there are multiple such snacks, Badugi will choose one arbitrarily. \n  * He repeats this process until he eats all n snacks. After that, he has to find the 1-st intersection again which also must be less than or equal to k meters away from the last snack he just ate. If he manages to find it, he completes the mission. Otherwise, he fails the mission. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Gildong doesn't know the value of k. So, he wants you to find the minimum value of k that makes it possible for Badugi to complete his mission, if Badugi moves optimally.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of intersections of the park.\n\nThe next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v) each, which means there is a road between intersection u and v. All roads are bidirectional and distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that: \n\n  * For each test case, for every a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n), it is possible to get to the b-th intersection from the a-th intersection. \n  * The sum of n in all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum possible value of k such that Badugi can complete the mission.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n8\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n1 5\n5 6\n6 7\n5 8\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n3\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first case, Badugi can complete his mission with k=2 by moving as follows: \n\n  1. Initially, Badugi is at the 1-st intersection. The closest snack is obviously at the 1-st intersection, so he just eats it. \n  2. Next, he looks for the closest snack, which can be either the one at the 2-nd or the one at the 3-rd intersection. Assume that he chooses the 2-nd intersection. He moves to the 2-nd intersection, which is 1 meter away, and eats the snack. \n  3. Now the only remaining snack is on the 3-rd intersection, and he needs to move along 2 paths to get to it. \n  4. After eating the snack at the 3-rd intersection, he needs to find the 1-st intersection again, which is only 1 meter away. As he gets back to it, he completes the mission. \n\n\n\nIn the second case, the only possible sequence of moves he can make is 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4 \u2013 1. Since the distance between the 4-th intersection and the 1-st intersection is 3, k needs to be at least 3 for Badugi to complete his mission.\n\nIn the third case, Badugi can make his moves as follows: 1 \u2013 5 \u2013 6 \u2013 7 \u2013 8 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4 \u2013 1. It can be shown that this is the only possible sequence of moves for Badugi to complete his mission with k=3.\n\n<image>",

        "instruction": "Gildong is playing with his dog, Badugi. They're at a park that has n intersections and n-1 bidirectional roads, each 1 meter in length and connecting two intersections with each other. The intersections are numbered from 1 to n, and for every a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n), it is possible to get to the b-th intersection from the a-th intersection using some set of roads.\n\nGildong has put one snack at every intersection of the park. Now Gildong will give Badugi a mission to eat all of the snacks. Badugi starts at the 1-st intersection, and he will move by the following rules:\n\n  * Badugi looks for snacks that are as close to him as possible. Here, the distance is the length of the shortest path from Badugi's current location to the intersection with the snack. However, Badugi's sense of smell is limited to k meters, so he can only find snacks that are less than or equal to k meters away from himself. If he cannot find any such snack, he fails the mission. \n  * Among all the snacks that Badugi can smell from his current location, he chooses a snack that minimizes the distance he needs to travel from his current intersection. If there are multiple such snacks, Badugi will choose one arbitrarily. \n  * He repeats this process until he eats all n snacks. After that, he has to find the 1-st intersection again which also must be less than or equal to k meters away from the last snack he just ate. If he manages to find it, he completes the mission. Otherwise, he fails the mission. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Gildong doesn't know the value of k. So, he wants you to find the minimum value of k that makes it possible for Badugi to complete his mission, if Badugi moves optimally.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of intersections of the park.\n\nThe next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v) each, which means there is a road between intersection u and v. All roads are bidirectional and distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that: \n\n  * For each test case, for every a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n), it is possible to get to the b-th intersection from the a-th intersection. \n  * The sum of n in all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum possible value of k such that Badugi can complete the mission.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n8\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n1 5\n5 6\n6 7\n5 8\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n3\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first case, Badugi can complete his mission with k=2 by moving as follows: \n\n  1. Initially, Badugi is at the 1-st intersection. The closest snack is obviously at the 1-st intersection, so he just eats it. \n  2. Next, he looks for the closest snack, which can be either the one at the 2-nd or the one at the 3-rd intersection. Assume that he chooses the 2-nd intersection. He moves to the 2-nd intersection, which is 1 meter away, and eats the snack. \n  3. Now the only remaining snack is on the 3-rd intersection, and he needs to move along 2 paths to get to it. \n  4. After eating the snack at the 3-rd intersection, he needs to find the 1-st intersection again, which is only 1 meter away. As he gets back to it, he completes the mission. \n\n\n\nIn the second case, the only possible sequence of moves he can make is 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4 \u2013 1. Since the distance between the 4-th intersection and the 1-st intersection is 3, k needs to be at least 3 for Badugi to complete his mission.\n\nIn the third case, Badugi can make his moves as follows: 1 \u2013 5 \u2013 6 \u2013 7 \u2013 8 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4 \u2013 1.

        "instruction": "Gildong is playing with his dog, Badugi. They're at a park that has n intersections and n-1 bidirectional roads, each 1 meter in length and connecting two intersections with each other. The intersections are numbered from 1 to n, and for every a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n), it is possible to get to the b-th intersection from the a-th intersection using some set of roads.\n\nGildong has put one snack at every intersection of the park. Now Gildong will give Badugi a mission to eat all of the snacks. Badugi starts at the 1-st intersection, and he will move by the following rules:\n\n  * Badugi looks for snacks that are as close to him as possible. Here, the distance is the length of the shortest path from Badugi's current location to the intersection with the snack. However, Badugi's sense of smell is limited to k meters, so he can only find snacks that are less than or equal to k meters away from himself. If he cannot find any such snack, he fails the mission. \n  * Among all the snacks that Badugi can smell from his current location, he chooses a snack that minimizes the distance he needs to travel from his current intersection. If there are multiple such snacks, Badugi will choose one arbitrarily. \n  * He repeats this process until he eats all n snacks. After that, he has to find the 1-st intersection again which also must be less than or equal to k meters away from the last snack he just ate. If he manages to find it, he completes the mission. Otherwise, he fails the mission. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Gildong doesn't know the value of k. So, he wants you to find the minimum value of k that makes it possible for Badugi to complete his mission, if Badugi moves optimally.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of intersections of the park.\n\nThe next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v) each, which means there is a road between intersection u and v. All roads are bidirectional and distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that: \n\n  * For each test case, for every a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n), it is possible to get to the b-th intersection from the a-th intersection. \n  * The sum of n in all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum possible value of k such that Badugi can complete the mission.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n8\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n1 5\n5 6\n6 7\n5 8\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n3\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first case, Badugi can complete his mission with k=2 by moving as follows: \n\n  1. Initially, Badugi is at the 1-st intersection. The closest snack is obviously at the 1-st intersection, so he just eats it. \n  2. Next, he looks for the closest snack, which can be either the one at the 2-nd or the one at the 3-rd intersection. Assume that he chooses the 2-nd intersection. He moves to the 2-nd intersection, which is 1 meter away, and eats the snack. \n  3. Now the only remaining snack is on the 3-rd intersection, and he needs to move along 2 paths to get to it. \n  4. After eating the snack at the 3-rd intersection, he needs to find the 1-st intersection again, which is only 1 meter away. As he gets back to it, he completes the mission. \n\n\n\nIn the second case, the only possible sequence of moves he can make is 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4 \u2013 1. Since the distance between the 4-th intersection and the 1-st intersection is 3, k needs to be at least 3 for Badugi to complete his mission.\n\nIn the third case, Badugi can make his moves as follows: 1 \u2013 5 \u2013 6 \u2013 7 \u2013 8 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 \u2013 4 \u2013 1. It can be shown that this is the only possible sequence of moves for Badugi to complete his mission with k=3.\n\n<image>",

If the current element a[now] has a previous occurrence, calculate the difference between the current index and the previous occurrence index, and add this difference to the segment tree sg[pre] for all elements up to the previous occurrence index.\n10. Find the minimum value in the segment tree sg[pre] up to the current index now-1, and store it in dp.\n11. If the current segment count is less than k, set the value in the segment tree sg[cur] at index now to dp.\n12. If the current index now is the last index of the array a and the current segment count is equal to k, update the answer ans with the value dp.\n13. Switch the current segment tree sg to the other tree sg[1-cur] for the next iteration.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <cassert>\n#include <cctype>\n#include <climits>\n#include

Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find all connected black pixels and update the `p` array.\n   c. Calculate the area of the shape using the `bfs2` function, which counts the number of pixels inside the shape.\n   d. Calculate the perimeter of the shape using the `bfs` function, which counts the number of pixels on the boundary of the shape.\n   e. Calculate the ratio of the area to the perimeter (`p = 4 * area / perimeter`).\n   f.

        "instruction": "This problem consists of three subproblems: for solving subproblem C1 you will receive 4 points, for solving subproblem C2 you will receive 4 points, and for solving subproblem C3 you will receive 8 points.\n\nManao decided to pursue a fighter's career. He decided to begin with an ongoing tournament. Before Manao joined, there were n contestants in the tournament, numbered from 1 to n. Each of them had already obtained some amount of tournament points, namely the i-th fighter had pi points.\n\nManao is going to engage in a single fight against each contestant. Each of Manao's fights ends in either a win or a loss. A win grants Manao one point, and a loss grants Manao's opponent one point. For each i, Manao estimated the amount of effort ei he needs to invest to win against the i-th contestant. Losing a fight costs no effort.\n\nAfter Manao finishes all of his fights, the ranklist will be determined, with 1 being the best rank and n + 1 being the worst. The contestants will be ranked in descending order of their tournament points. The contestants with the same number of points as Manao will be ranked better than him if they won the match against him and worse otherwise. The exact mechanism of breaking ties for other fighters is not relevant here.\n\nManao's objective is to have rank k or better. Determine the minimum total amount of effort he needs to invest in order to fulfill this goal, if it is possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a pair of integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n + 1). The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers separated by a single space \u2014 pi and ei (0 \u2264 pi, ei \u2264 200000).\n\nThe problem consists of three subproblems. The subproblems have different constraints on the input. You will get some score for the correct submission of the subproblem. The description of the subproblems follows.\n\n  * In subproblem C1 (4 points), the constraint 1 \u2264 n \u2264 15 will hold. \n  * In subproblem C2 (4 points), the constraint 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 will hold. \n  * In subproblem C3 (8 points), the constraint 1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000 will hold. \n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single number in a single line \u2014 the minimum amount of effort Manao needs to use to rank in the top k. If no amount of effort can earn Manao such a rank, output number -1.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n3 2\n1 1\n1 4\n2 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n2 1\n3 2\n4 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n-1\n\n\nInput\n\n5 2\n2 10\n2 10\n1 1\n3 1\n3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n12\n\nNote\n\nConsider the first test case. At the time when Manao joins the tournament, there are three fighters. The first of them has 1 tournament point and the victory against him requires 1 unit of effort. The second contestant also has 1 tournament point, but Manao needs 4 units of effort to defeat him. The third contestant has 2 points and victory against him costs Manao 2 units of effort. Manao's goal is top be in top 2. The optimal decision is to win against fighters 1 and 3, after which Manao, fighter 2, and fighter 3 will all have 2 points. Manao will rank better than fighter 3 and worse than fighter 2, thus finishing in second place.\n\nConsider the second test case. Even if Manao wins against both opponents, he will still rank third.",
