Due to the nature of the game, Ziota cannot use the Pistol (the first type of gun) or AWP (the third type of gun) to shoot the boss before killing all of the a_i normal monsters.\n\nIf Ziota damages the boss but does not kill it immediately, he is forced to move out of the current level to an arbitrary adjacent level (adjacent levels of level i (1 < i < n) are levels i - 1 and i + 1, the only adjacent level of level 1 is level 2, the only adjacent level of level n is level n - 1). Ziota can also choose to move to an adjacent level at any time. Each move between adjacent levels are managed by portals with d teleportation time.\n\nIn order not to disrupt the space-time continuum within the game, it is strictly forbidden to reload or shoot monsters during teleportation. \n\nZiota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is rather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about the minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the monsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns).

Due to the nature of the game, Ziota cannot use the Pistol (the first type of gun) or AWP (the third type of gun) to shoot the boss before killing all of the a_i normal monsters.\n\nIf Ziota damages the boss but does not kill it immediately, he is forced to move out of the current level to an arbitrary adjacent level (adjacent levels of level i (1 < i < n) are levels i - 1 and i + 1, the only adjacent level of level 1 is level 2, the only adjacent level of level n is level n - 1). Ziota can also choose to move to an adjacent level at any time. Each move between adjacent levels are managed by portals with d teleportation time.\n\nIn order not to disrupt the space-time continuum within the game, it is strictly forbidden to reload or shoot monsters during teleportation. \n\nZiota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is rather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about the minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the monsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns).

        "instruction": "Let's consider a (10^9+1) \u00d7 (10^9+1) field. The rows are numbered with integers from 0 to 10^9 and the columns are numbered with integers from 0 to 10^9. Let's define as (x, y) the cell located in the x-th row and y-th column.\n\nLet's call a cell (x, y) good if x \\& y = 0, there \\& is the [bitwise and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) operation.\n\nLet's build a graph where vertices will be all good cells of the field and we will make an edge between all pairs of adjacent by side good cells. It can be proved that this graph will be a tree \u2014 connected graph without cycles. Let's hang this tree on vertex (0, 0), so we will have a rooted tree with root (0, 0).\n\nTwo players will play the game. Initially, some good cells are black and others are white. Each player on his turn chooses a black good cell and a subset of its ancestors (possibly empty) and inverts their colors (from white to black and vice versa). The player who can't move (because all good cells are white) loses. It can be proved that the game is always finite.\n\nInitially, all cells are white. You are given m pairs of cells. For each pair color all cells in a simple path between them as black. Note that we do not invert their colors, we paint them black.\n\nSohrab and Mashtali are going to play this game. Sohrab is the first player and Mashtali is the second.\n\nMashtali wants to win and decided to cheat. He can make the following operation multiple times before the game starts: choose a cell and invert colors of all vertices on the path between it and the root of the tree.\n\nMammad who was watching them wondered: \"what is the minimum number of operations Mashtali should do to have a winning strategy?\".\n\nFind the answer to this question for the initial painting of the tree. It can be proved that at least one possible way to cheat always exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains four integers x_{1}, y_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2} (0 \u2264 x_i, y_i \u2264 10^9, x_i \\& y_i = 0). You should color all cells on the path between vertices (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) as black.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of cheating operations the second player can do.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n7 0 0 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n1 2 3 4\n3 4 1 2\n2 1 3 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n0 1 0 8\n1 0 8 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test, you can make one cheating operation with the root of the tree. After that, the second player can win because he can use a symmetric strategy.\n\nIn the second test, you can make cheating operations with cells (0, 2), (0, 0), (3, 4).\n\nIn the third test, the second player already has the winning strategy and doesn't need to make any cheating operations.",

For each pair, find the simple path between them and color all cells on this path as black.\n3. Identify the good cells (cells where x & y = 0) and create a graph where vertices are these good cells and edges connect adjacent good cells.\n4. Determine the rooted tree structure of the graph with the root at (0, 0).\n5. Initialize an empty list to store the segments that need to be flipped.\n6. Iterate through the colored paths and split them into segments based on the bit boundaries (where x or y changes).\n7. For each segment, check if it is a horizontal or vertical segment and add the corresponding segment to the list.\n8. If a segment is a horizontal segment and it starts at (0, y), add 1 to the list of segments to flip.\n9. If a segment is a vertical segment and it starts at (x, 0), add 1 to the list of segments to flip.\n10. Sort the list of segments to flip.\n11. Initialize a variable to store the minimum number of cheating operations needed.\n12. Iterate through the sorted list of segments to flip and count the number of segments that need to be flipped.\n13. The minimum number of cheating operations needed is the count of segments that need to be flipped divided by 2 (since flipping a segment flips an even number of cells).\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing uint = unsigned int;\nusing cat = long long;\nusing dbl = long double;\nconstexpr dbl pi = 3.14159265358979323846;\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to calculate absolute value\ntemplate <typename T>\nT abs(T x) {\n  return (x < 0)?

        "instruction": "In some country live wizards. They like to make weird bets.\n\nTwo wizards draw an acyclic directed graph with n vertices and m edges (the graph's vertices are numbered from 1 to n). A source is a vertex with no incoming edges, and a sink is the vertex with no outgoing edges. Note that a vertex could be the sink and the source simultaneously. In the wizards' graph the number of the sinks and the sources is the same.\n\nWizards numbered the sources in the order of increasing numbers of the vertices from 1 to k. The sinks are numbered from 1 to k in the similar way.\n\nTo make a bet, they, as are real wizards, cast a spell, which selects a set of k paths from all sources to the sinks in such a way that no two paths intersect at the vertices. In this case, each sink has exactly one path going to it from exactly one source. Let's suppose that the i-th sink has a path going to it from the ai's source. Then let's call pair (i, j) an inversion if i < j and ai > aj. If the number of inversions among all possible pairs (i, j), such that (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 k), is even, then the first wizard wins (the second one gives him one magic coin). Otherwise, the second wizard wins (he gets one magic coin from the first one).\n\nOur wizards are captured with feverish excitement, so they kept choosing new paths again and again for so long that eventually they have chosen every possible set of paths for exactly once. The two sets of non-intersecting pathes are considered to be different, if and only if there is an edge, which lies at some path in one set and doesn't lie at any path of another set. To check their notes, they asked you to count the total winnings of the first player for all possible sets of paths modulo a prime number p.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 600, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 105, 2 \u2264 p \u2264 109 + 7). It is guaranteed that p is prime number.\n\nNext m lines contain edges of the graph. Each line contains a pair of space-separated integers, ai bi \u2014 an edge from vertex ai to vertex bi. It is guaranteed that the graph is acyclic and that the graph contains the same number of sources and sinks. Please note that the graph can have multiple edges.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer to the problem \u2014 the total winnings of the first player modulo a prime number p.

        "instruction": "In some country live wizards. They like to make weird bets.\n\nTwo wizards draw an acyclic directed graph with n vertices and m edges (the graph's vertices are numbered from 1 to n). A source is a vertex with no incoming edges, and a sink is the vertex with no outgoing edges. Note that a vertex could be the sink and the source simultaneously. In the wizards' graph the number of the sinks and the sources is the same.\n\nWizards numbered the sources in the order of increasing numbers of the vertices from 1 to k. The sinks are numbered from 1 to k in the similar way.\n\nTo make a bet, they, as are real wizards, cast a spell, which selects a set of k paths from all sources to the sinks in such a way that no two paths intersect at the vertices. In this case, each sink has exactly one path going to it from exactly one source. Let's suppose that the i-th sink has a path going to it from the ai's source. Then let's call pair (i, j) an inversion if i < j and ai > aj. If the number of inversions among all possible pairs (i, j), such that (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 k), is even, then the first wizard wins (the second one gives him one magic coin). Otherwise, the second wizard wins (he gets one magic coin from the first one).\n\nOur wizards are captured with feverish excitement, so they kept choosing new paths again and again for so long that eventually they have chosen every possible set of paths for exactly once. The two sets of non-intersecting pathes are considered to be different, if and only if there is an edge, which lies at some path in one set and doesn't lie at any path of another set. To check their notes, they asked you to count the total winnings of the first player for all possible sets of paths modulo a prime number p.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 600, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 105, 2 \u2264 p \u2264 109 + 7). It is guaranteed that p is prime number.\n\nNext m lines contain edges of the graph. Each line contains a pair of space-separated integers, ai bi \u2014 an edge from vertex ai to vertex bi. It is guaranteed that the graph is acyclic and that the graph contains the same number of sources and sinks.

This function takes a character `c` and its length `len` as input and adds it to the automaton.\n2. Sort the lengths of the leaves in the automaton in descending order using the `sort` function. This is done to ensure that we process the longer substrings first.\n3. Initialize an array `v` to store the number of occurrences of each substring in the automaton. The value of `v[i]` represents the number of occurrences of the substring corresponding to node `i` in the automaton.\n4. Traverse the sorted lengths and update the values in the `v` array. For each length `i`, we update the value of `v[fa[i]]` by adding the value of `v[i]`. This is done to count the occurrences of the substrings that are proper prefixes of the current substring.\n5. Read the number of queries `t` and the query strings `x`.\n6. For each query string `x`, call the `match` function to count the number of occurrences of `x` in the input string `s`.

Note that not everybody runs in the same manner as everybody else. Some people run in the clockwise direction, some of them run in the counter-clockwise direction. It mostly depends on the runner's mood in the morning, so you can assume that each running direction is equiprobable for each runner in any fixed morning. \n\nThe stadium is tiny and is in need of major repair, for right now there only is one running track! You can't get too playful on a single track, that's why all runners keep the same running speed \u2014 exactly 1 meter per a time unit. Nevertheless, the runners that choose different directions bump into each other as they meet. \n\nThe company wants to design a new stadium, but they first need to know how bad the old one is. For that they need the expectation of the number of bumpings by t time units after the running has begun. Help the company count the required expectation. Note that each runner chooses a direction equiprobably, independently from the others and then all runners start running simultaneously at 7 a.m. Assume that each runner runs for t time units without stopping. Consider the runners to bump at a certain moment if at that moment they found themselves at the same point in the stadium. A pair of runners can bump more than once.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, l, t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 106, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 109, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 109). The next line contains n distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 \u2264 a1 < a2 < ... < an < l), here ai is the clockwise distance from the start line to the i-th runner's starting position.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single real number \u2014 the answer to the problem with absolute or relative error of at most 10 - 6.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 5 1\n0 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n0.2500000000\n\n\nInput\n\n3 7 3\n0 1 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n1.5000000000\n\nNote\n\nThere are two runners in the first example. If the first runner run clockwise direction, then in 1 time unit he will be 1m away from the start line. If the second runner run counter-clockwise direction then in 1 time unit he will be also 1m away from the start line. And it is the only possible way to meet.

Neo has so-called \"deja vu\" outbursts when he gets visions of events in some places he's been at or is going to be at. Let's examine the phenomenon in more detail.\n\nWe can say that Neo's city is represented by a directed graph, consisting of n shops and m streets that connect the shops. No two streets connect the same pair of shops (besides, there can't be one street from A to B and one street from B to A). No street connects a shop with itself. As Neo passes some streets, he gets visions. No matter how many times he passes street k, every time he will get the same visions in the same order. A vision is a sequence of shops.\n\nWe know that Neo is going to get really shocked if he passes the way from some shop a to some shop b, possible coinciding with a, such that the list of visited shops in the real life and in the visions coincide.\n\nSuggest beaver Neo such path of non-zero length.

Note that the order of the visions matters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total number of visions on all streets doesn't exceed 105.\n\n  * to get 50 points, you need to find any (not necessarily simple) path of length at most 2\u00b7n, that meets the attributes described above (subproblem E1); \n  * to get 50 more points, you need to count for each length from 1 to 2\u00b7n the number of paths that have the attribute described above (subproblem E2). \n\nOutput\n\nSubproblem E1. In the first line print an integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 2\u00b7n) \u2014 the numbers of shops on Neo's path. In the next line print k integers \u2014 the number of shops in the order Neo passes them.

Change the value of a specific cell. It is described by three integers: \"t i v\", where t = 1 (the type of operation), i \u2014 the number of the cell to change and v the value to assign to the cell. \n  2.

Store the coordinates of the changed cells in a vector of pairs, A, where each pair contains the row and column of a changed cell.\n3. Sort the vector A based on the column of the changed cells.\n4. Initialize a 2D boolean array, flag, to keep track of which cells in each row need to be changed.\n5. Iterate through the sorted vector A and update the flag array accordingly. If a changed cell is in the last row or column of the pyramid, it requires a single operation to change. Otherwise, it requires two operations: one to change the subpyramid and another to change the individual cell.\n6. Initialize a dynamic programming array, dp, to store the minimum cost of changing the cells in each row.\n7. Iterate through each row of the pyramid and update the dp array. For each row, calculate the minimum cost of changing the cells in that row by considering two options: either change the cells in the current row or change the cells in the previous row and then change the cells in the current row.\n8. The minimum cost of changing all cells in the pyramid is stored in the last element of the dp array.\n9.

In large electronic sports competitions where Kostya's team is going to participate, the matches are held in the Captains Mode. In this mode the captains select the heroes by making one of two possible actions in a certain, predetermined order: pick or ban.\n\n  * To pick a hero for the team. After the captain picks, the picked hero goes to his team (later one of a team members will play it) and can no longer be selected by any of the teams. \n  * To ban a hero. After the ban the hero is not sent to any of the teams, but it still can no longer be selected by any of the teams. \n\n\n\nThe team captain may miss a pick or a ban. If he misses a pick, a random hero is added to his team from those that were available at that moment, and if he misses a ban, no hero is banned, as if there was no ban.\n\nKostya has already identified the strength of all the heroes based on the new patch fixes.

Valve Corporation, the developer of this game, has recently released a new patch which turned the balance of the game upside down. Kostya, as the captain of the team, realizes that the greatest responsibility lies on him, so he wants to resort to the analysis of innovations patch from the mathematical point of view to choose the best heroes for his team in every game.\n\nA Dota 2 match involves two teams, each of them must choose some heroes that the players of the team are going to play for, and it is forbidden to choose the same hero several times, even in different teams. In large electronic sports competitions where Kostya's team is going to participate, the matches are held in the Captains Mode. In this mode the captains select the heroes by making one of two possible actions in a certain, predetermined order: pick or ban.\n\n  * To pick a hero for the team. After the captain picks, the picked hero goes to his team (later one of a team members will play it) and can no longer be selected by any of the teams. \n  * To ban a hero. After the ban the hero is not sent to any of the teams, but it still can no longer be selected by any of the teams. \n\n\n\nThe team captain may miss a pick or a ban. If he misses a pick, a random hero is added to his team from those that were available at that moment, and if he misses a ban, no hero is banned, as if there was no ban.\n\nKostya has already identified the strength of all the heroes based on the new patch fixes. Of course, Kostya knows the order of picks and bans. The strength of a team is the sum of the strengths of the team's heroes and both teams that participate in the match seek to maximize the difference in strengths in their favor. Help Kostya determine what team, the first one or the second one, has advantage in the match, and how large the advantage is.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of heroes in Dota 2.\n\nThe second line contains n integers s1, s2, ..., sn (1 \u2264 si \u2264 106) \u2014 the strengths of all the heroes.\n\nThe third line contains a single integer m (2 \u2264 m \u2264 min(n, 20)) \u2014 the number of actions the captains of the team must perform.\n\nNext m lines look like \"action team\", where action is the needed action: a pick (represented as a \"p\") or a ban (represented as a \"b\"), and team is the number of the team that needs to perform the action (number 1 or 2).\n\nIt is guaranteed that each team makes at least one pick. Besides, each team has the same number of picks and the same number of bans.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the difference between the strength of the first team and the strength of the second team if the captains of both teams will act optimally well.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2\n2 1\n2\np 1\np 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n6\n6 4 5 4 5 5\n4\nb 2\np 1\nb 1\np 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\n\nInput\n\n4\n1 2 3 4\n4\np 2\nb 2\np 1\nb 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n-2",

However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can't figure out for which value of n the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!\n\nMostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:\n\n  * function ::= int f(int n) {operatorSequence}\n  * operatorSequence ::= operator | operator operatorSequence\n  * operator ::= return arithmExpr; | if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;\n  * logicalExpr ::= arithmExpr > arithmExpr | arithmExpr < arithmExpr | arithmExpr == arithmExpr\n  * arithmExpr ::= sum\n  * sum ::= product | sum + product | sum - product\n  * product ::= multiplier | product * multiplier | product / multiplier\n  * multiplier ::= n | number | f(arithmExpr)\n  * number ::= 0|1|2|... |32767\n\n\n\nThe whitespaces in a operatorSequence are optional.\n\nThus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator \"return arithmExpr;\" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator \"if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;\" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language \u2014 cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the n parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].\n\nThe operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right. Operations \">\" (more), \"<\" (less) and \"==\" (equals) also have standard meanings.\n\nNow you've got to pay close attention! The program is compiled with the help of 15-bit Berland C++ compiler invented by a Berland company BerSoft, that's why arithmetical operations are performed in a non-standard way. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division \"/\" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.\n\nExamples of arithmetical operations: \n\n<image>\n\nGuaranteed that for all values of n from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:\n\n1. Division by 0 never occures.\n\n2. When performing a function for the value n = N recursive calls of the function f may occur only for the parameter value of 0, 1, ..., N - 1. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.\n\n3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.\n\nWe have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function f is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of n parameter. That's why the f function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of n from the interval [0..32767] and a value of f(n) from the same interval.\n\nGiven the value of f(n), and you should find n.

Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division \"/\" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.\n\nExamples of arithmetical operations: \n\n<image>\n\nGuaranteed that for all values of n from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:\n\n1. Division by 0 never occures.\n\n2. When performing a function for the value n = N recursive calls of the function f may occur only for the parameter value of 0, 1, ..., N - 1. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.\n\n3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.\n\nWe have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function f is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of n parameter. That's why the f function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of n from the interval [0..32767] and a value of f(n) from the same interval.\n\nGiven the value of f(n), and you should find n. If the suitable n value is not unique, you should find the maximal one (from the interval [0..32767]).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line has an integer f(n) from the interval [0..32767]. The next lines have the description of the function f. In the description can be found extra spaces and line breaks (see the examples) which, of course, can\u2019t break key words int, if, return and numbers. The size of input data can\u2019t exceed 100 bytes.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem.

The history has no records concerning how long the program had been working. By the time Petya returned, it had completed the calculations and had the result. However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can't figure out for which value of n the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!\n\nMostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:\n\n  * function ::= int f(int n) {operatorSequence}\n  * operatorSequence ::= operator | operator operatorSequence\n  * operator ::= return arithmExpr; | if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;\n  * logicalExpr ::= arithmExpr > arithmExpr | arithmExpr < arithmExpr | arithmExpr == arithmExpr\n  * arithmExpr ::= sum\n  * sum ::= product | sum + product | sum - product\n  * product ::= multiplier | product * multiplier | product / multiplier\n  * multiplier ::= n | number | f(arithmExpr)\n  * number ::= 0|1|2|... |32767\n\n\n\nThe whitespaces in a operatorSequence are optional.\n\nThus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator \"return arithmExpr;\" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator \"if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;\" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language \u2014 cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the n parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].\n\nThe operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right.

Choose several (at least one) first elements of sequence a (non-empty prefix of a), choose several (at least one) first elements of sequence b (non-empty prefix of b); the element of sequence a with the maximum index among the chosen ones must be equal to the element of sequence b with the maximum index among the chosen ones; remove the chosen elements from the sequences. \n  2. Remove all elements of both sequences. \n\n\n\nThe first action is worth e energy units and adds one dollar to Sereja's electronic account. The second action is worth the number of energy units equal to the number of elements Sereja removed from the sequences before performing this action.

        "instruction": "Oscolcovo city has a campus consisting of n student dormitories, n universities and n military offices. Initially, the i-th dormitory belongs to the i-th university and is assigned to the i-th military office.\n\nLife goes on and the campus is continuously going through some changes. The changes can be of four types:\n\n  1. University aj merges with university bj. After that all the dormitories that belonged to university bj are assigned to to university aj, and university bj disappears. \n  2. Military office cj merges with military office dj. After that all the dormitories that were assigned to military office dj, are assigned to military office cj, and military office dj disappears. \n  3. Students of university xj move in dormitories. Lets kxj is the number of dormitories that belong to this university at the time when the students move in. Then the number of students in each dormitory of university xj increases by kxj (note that the more dormitories belong to the university, the more students move in each dormitory of the university). \n  4. Military office number yj conducts raids on all the dormitories assigned to it and takes all students from there. \n\n\n\nThus, at each moment of time each dormitory is assigned to exactly one university and one military office. Initially, all the dormitory are empty.\n\nYour task is to process the changes that take place in the campus and answer the queries, how many people currently live in dormitory qj.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers, n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 5\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of dormitories and the number of queries, respectively.\n\nNext m lines contain the queries, each of them is given in one of the following formats: \n\n  * \u00abU aj bj\u00bb \u2014 merging universities; \n  * \u00abM cj dj\u00bb \u2014 merging military offices; \n  * \u00abA xj\u00bb \u2014 students of university xj moving in the dormitories; \n  * \u00abZ yj\u00bb \u2014 a raid in military office yj; \n  * \u00abQ qj\u00bb \u2014 a query asking the number of people in dormitory qj. \n\nAll the numbers in the queries are positive integers and do not exceed n. It is guaranteed that at the moment of the query the universities and military offices, that are present in the query, exist.\n\nOutput\n\nIn the i-th line print the answer to the i-th query asking the number of people in the dormitory.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 7\nA 1\nQ 1\nU 1 2\nA 1\nZ 1\nQ 1\nQ 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n0\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n5 12\nU 1 2\nM 4 5\nA 1\nQ 1\nA 3\nA 4\nQ 3\nQ 4\nZ 4\nQ 4\nA 5\nQ 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\nNote\n\nConsider the first sample test: \n\n  * In the first query university 1 owns only dormitory 1, so after the query dormitory 1 will have 1 student. \n  * After the third query university 1 owns dormitories 1 and 2. \n  * The fourth query increases by 2 the number of students living in dormitories 1 and 2 that belong to university number 1. After that 3 students live in the first dormitory and 2 students live in the second dormitory. \n  * At the fifth query the number of students living in dormitory 1, assigned to the military office 1, becomes zero.

Initialize the data structures: fa (parent array), cnt (current count), rt (root array), zhi (zhi array), tot (total count), add (add array), sum (sum array), ans (answer array), and l, r (node arrays).\n3. Process each query:\n   - If the query is a university merge (U aj bj), merge the universities and update the root and zhi arrays.\n   - If the query is a military office merge (M cj dj), merge the military offices and update the root and zhi arrays.\n   - If the query is students moving in (A xj), update the add array.\n   - If the query is a raid (Z yj), update the zhi array.\n   - If the query is a query (Q qj), store the query information in the l and r arrays.\n4. Sort the l and r arrays based on the bh (bh array) field.\n5. Initialize the fa and zhi arrays to their initial states.\n6. Iterate through the sorted l and r arrays, updating the ans array based on the current state of the fa and zhi arrays.\n7.
