Convert the string `s` into a list of integers `data`, where `1` represents a white block and `0` represents a black block.\n3. Count the number of blocks that need to be flipped to make all blocks the same color. This is done by iterating through the list `data` and counting the number of times we encounter a `0` followed by another `0`. If we encounter a `0` followed by a `1`, we increment the count by `1`. If the count is odd, it means we cannot make all blocks the same color, so we return `None`.\n4. If the length of `data` is even and the count is odd, we flip all the blocks by inverting the values in `data`.\n5. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the positions of the blocks that need to be flipped.\n6. Iterate through `data` and for each `0`, append its index to `result` and flip the next block in `data`.\n7.
