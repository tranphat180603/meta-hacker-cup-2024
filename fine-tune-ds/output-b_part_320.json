Determine the target color to make all blocks of the same color. If the number of black blocks is odd, set the target color to \"B\", otherwise set it to \"W\".\n6. Initialize variables `k` to count the number of operations and `ans` to store the positions of the blocks to be inverted.\n7. Iterate through the blocks. If a block's color does not match the target color, invert the colors of the current block and the next block, increment `k`, and append the position of the current block to `ans`.\n8.

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the number of test cases `t` from the input.\n2. Iterate `t` times to process each test case.\n3. For each test case, read the integer `n` from the input.\n4. Check if `n` is less than 24. If true, it's impossible to find three distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that `2 \u2264 a, b, c` and `a \u22c5 b \u22c5 c = n`. Print \"NO\" and move to the next test case.\n5. If `n` is greater than or equal to 24, check if `n` is a perfect cube. If true, it's impossible to find three distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that `2 \u2264 a, b, c` and `a \u22c5 b \u22c5 c = n`. Print \"NO\" and move to the next test case.\n6. If `n` is not a perfect cube, find the smallest factor `k` of `n` greater than 1.\n7. If `k` is the square root of `n`, it's impossible to find three distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that `2 \u2264 a, b, c` and `a \u22c5 b \u22c5 c = n`. Print \"NO\" and move to the next test case.\n8. If `n` is a perfect square and not a perfect cube, it's impossible to find three distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that `2 \u2264 a, b, c` and `a \u22c5 b \u22c5 c = n`. Print \"NO\" and move to the next test case.\n9. If none of the above conditions are met, find three distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that `2 \u2264 a, b, c` and `a \u22c5 b \u22c5 c = n`.
