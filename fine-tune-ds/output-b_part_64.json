        "instruction": "There are n blocks arranged in a row and numbered from left to right, starting from one. Each block is either black or white. \n\nYou may perform the following operation zero or more times: choose two adjacent blocks and invert their colors (white block becomes black, and vice versa). \n\nYou want to find a sequence of operations, such that they make all the blocks having the same color. You don't have to minimize the number of operations, but it should not exceed 3 \u22c5 n. If it is impossible to find such a sequence of operations, you need to report it.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200) \u2014 the number of blocks.\n\nThe second line contains one string s consisting of n characters, each character is either \"W\" or \"B\". If the i-th character is \"W\", then the i-th block is white. If the i-th character is \"B\", then the i-th block is black. \n\nOutput\n\nIf it is impossible to make all the blocks having the same color, print -1.\n\nOtherwise, print an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 3 \u22c5 n) \u2014 the number of operations. Then print k integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_k (1 \u2264 p_j \u2264 n - 1), where p_j is the position of the left block in the pair of blocks that should be affected by the j-th operation.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n8\nBWWWWWWB\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n6 2 4\n\n\nInput\n\n\n4\nBWBB\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nWWWWW\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n\n\nInput\n\n\n3\nBWB\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n2 1 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, it is possible to make all blocks black in 3 operations. Start with changing blocks 6 and 7, so the sequence is \"BWWWWBBB\". Then change blocks 2 and 3, so the sequence is \"BBBWWBB\". And finally, change blocks 4 and 5, so all blocks are black.\n\nIt is impossible to make all colors equal in the second example.\n\nAll blocks are already white in the third example.\n\nIn the fourth example it is possible to make all blocks white in two operations: first operation is to change blocks 2 and 3 (so the sequence is \"BBW\"), and then change blocks 1 and 2 (so all blocks are white).",
        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the number of blocks `n` and the string `s` representing the colors of the blocks.\n2. Initialize counters `b` and `w` to keep track of the number of black and white blocks, respectively.\n3. Create a dictionary `pos` to store the positions of black and white blocks.\n4. Iterate through the string `s` to populate the `pos` dictionary and update the counters `b` and `w`.\n5. Check if it's impossible to make all blocks have the same color by verifying if both `b` and `w` are odd. If so, print -1 and return.\n6. Determine the target color by checking if `b` is even or odd. If `b` is even, set the target color to black; otherwise, set it to white.\n7. Initialize variables `to_print` and `lngth` to store the sequence of operations and the length of the sequence, respectively.\n8. Iterate through the positions of the target color in the `pos` dictionary, starting from the first position and incrementing by 2.\n9. For each pair of positions, iterate through the range of positions and append the position plus 1 to `to_print` and increment `lngth`.\n10. Print the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Read the number of blocks and the string representing the colors of the blocks\n    n = int(input())\n    line = input()\n\n    # Initialize counters for black and white blocks\n    b = 0\n    w = 0\n\n    # Create a dictionary to store the positions of black and white blocks\n    pos = dict()\n    pos[\"B\"] = []\n    pos[\"W\"] = []\n\n    # Iterate through the string to populate the pos dictionary and update the counters\n    for i in range(len(line)):\n        if line[i] == \"B\":\n            # Increment the black block counter and append the position to the pos dictionary\n            b += 1\n            pos[\"B\"].append(i)\n        else:\n            # Increment the white block counter and append the position to the pos dictionary\n            pos[\"W\"].append(i)\n            w += 1\n\n    # Check if it's impossible to make all blocks have the same color\n    if b % 2 == 1 and w % 2 == 1:\n        # Print -1 and return if it's impossible\n        print(-1)\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Determine the target color\n        if b % 2 == 0:\n            # If b is even, set the target color to black\n            key = \"B\"\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, set the target color to white\n            key = \"W\"\n\n        # Convert the string to a list for easier manipulation\n        line = list(line)\n\n        # Initialize variables to store the sequence of operations and its length\n        to_print = \"\"\n        lngth = 0\n\n        # Iterate through the positions of the target color in the pos dictionary\n        for i in range(0, len(pos[key]), 2):\n            # Iterate through the range of positions\n            for k in range(pos[key][i], pos[key][i + 1]):\n                # Append the position plus 1 to to_print and increment lngth\n                to_print += str(k + 1) + \" \"\n                lngth += 1\n\n        # Print the length of the sequence and the sequence itself\n        print(lngth)\n        print(to_print)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    t = 1\n    for i in range(t):\n        main()\n```",
