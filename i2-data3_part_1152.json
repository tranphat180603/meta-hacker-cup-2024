Furthermore, the number of wires was exactly one less than the number of lamps.\n\nThere was something unusual about the garland. Each lamp had its own brightness which depended on the temperature of the lamp. Temperatures could be positive, negative or zero. Dima has two friends, so he decided to share the garland with them. He wants to cut two different wires so that the garland breaks up into three parts. Each part of the garland should shine equally, i. e. the sums of lamps' temperatures should be equal in each of the parts. Of course, each of the parts should be non-empty, i. e. each part should contain at least one lamp.\n\n<image>\n\nHelp Dima to find a suitable way to cut the garland, or determine that this is impossible.\n\nWhile examining the garland, Dima lifted it up holding by one of the lamps. Thus, each of the lamps, except the one he is holding by, is now hanging on some wire. So, you should print two lamp ids as the answer which denote that Dima should cut the wires these lamps are hanging on.

Dima remembered that each two lamps in the garland were connected directly or indirectly via some wires. Furthermore, the number of wires was exactly one less than the number of lamps.\n\nThere was something unusual about the garland. Each lamp had its own brightness which depended on the temperature of the lamp. Temperatures could be positive, negative or zero. Dima has two friends, so he decided to share the garland with them. He wants to cut two different wires so that the garland breaks up into three parts. Each part of the garland should shine equally, i. e. the sums of lamps' temperatures should be equal in each of the parts. Of course, each of the parts should be non-empty, i. e. each part should contain at least one lamp.\n\n<image>\n\nHelp Dima to find a suitable way to cut the garland, or determine that this is impossible.\n\nWhile examining the garland, Dima lifted it up holding by one of the lamps. Thus, each of the lamps, except the one he is holding by, is now hanging on some wire. So, you should print two lamp ids as the answer which denote that Dima should cut the wires these lamps are hanging on. Of course, the lamp Dima is holding the garland by can't be included in the answer.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains single integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 106) \u2014 the number of lamps in the garland.\n\nThen n lines follow. The i-th of them contain the information about the i-th lamp: the number lamp ai, it is hanging on (and 0, if is there is no such lamp), and its temperature ti ( - 100 \u2264 ti \u2264 100). The lamps are numbered from 1 to n.\n\nOutput\n\nIf there is no solution, print -1.\n\nOtherwise print two integers \u2014 the indexes of the lamps which mean Dima should cut the wires they are hanging on.

If after any move player lost, in other words player move to dangerous cell, then x and y will be equal to  - 1.\n\nIf after any move player is in finish or dangerous cell, then you should terminate your program.\n\nTo finish output buffer (i. e. for operation flush) right after printing direction and newline you should do next:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) in C++ \n  * System.out.flush() in Java \n  * stdout.flush() in Python \n  * flush(output) in Pascal \n  * read documentation for other languages. \n\n\n\nHacks\n\nTo perform a hack you should use this format:\n    \n    \n      \n    n m swapLR swapUD    \n    a_1    \n    a_2    \n    ...    \n    a_n  \n    \n\nWhere n, m \u2014 number of rows and columns in game field. swapLR is equal to 1 in case, when directions \"L\u2019\u2019 and \"R\u2019\u2019 is swapped, and equal to 0 otherwise. swapUD is equal to 1, when directions \"U\u2019\u2019 and \"D\u2019\u2019 is swapped, and equal to 0 otherwise. a1, a2, ..., an \u2014 description of corresponding rows of game field.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n4 3\n...\n**.\nF*.\n...\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 3\n2 3\n3 3\n4 3\n4 2\n4 1\n3 1\n\n\nOutput\n\nR\nL\nL\nD\nU\nU\nU\nR\nR\nD\n\nNote\n\nIn first test case all four directions swapped with their opposite directions.

Once the minimum number of parts `parts` is determined, calculate the length of each part `len` by dividing the total length `n` by `parts`.\n7. Create three deques `a`, `b`, and `c` to store the characters of the string `s` in a way that they can be rearranged to form palindromes.\n8. Distribute the characters from the frequency map `mp` into the deques `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `a` and `b` contain pairs of characters and `c` contains any remaining characters.\n9. Rearrange the characters in the deques `a` and `b` to form palindromes of length `len`.\n10. Construct the final palindromes by taking characters from the deques `a`, `b`, and `c` in the required order and print them.\n\nCOMMENTED CODE:\n```python\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid itval(istream_iterator<string> it) {}\ntemplate <typename T, typename...

He should make a small speech, but every time he pronounces a word that contains the selected letter, he receives an electric shock. He can make guesses which letter is selected, but for each incorrect guess he receives an electric shock too. The show ends when Valentin guesses the selected letter correctly.\n\nValentin can't keep in mind everything, so he could guess the selected letter much later than it can be uniquely determined and get excessive electric shocks. Excessive electric shocks are those which Valentin got after the moment the selected letter can be uniquely determined. You should find out the number of excessive electric shocks.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of actions Valentin did.\n\nThe next n lines contain descriptions of his actions, each line contains description of one action. Each action can be of one of three types: \n\n  1. Valentin pronounced some word and didn't get an electric shock. This action is described by the string \". w\" (without quotes), in which \".\" is a dot (ASCII-code 46), and w is the word that Valentin said. \n  2. Valentin pronounced some word and got an electric shock. This action is described by the string \"! w\" (without quotes), in which \"!\" is an exclamation mark (ASCII-code 33), and w is the word that Valentin said. \n  3. Valentin made a guess about the selected letter. This action is described by the string \"? s\" (without quotes), in which \"?\" is a question mark (ASCII-code 63), and s is the guess \u2014 a lowercase English letter. \n\n\n\nAll words consist only of lowercase English letters. The total length of all words does not exceed 105.\n\nIt is guaranteed that last action is a guess about the selected letter. Also, it is guaranteed that Valentin didn't make correct guesses about the selected letter before the last action. Moreover, it's guaranteed that if Valentin got an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it contains the selected letter; and also if Valentin didn't get an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it does not contain the selected letter.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of electric shocks that Valentin could have avoided if he had told the selected letter just after it became uniquely determined.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n5\n! abc\n. ad\n. b\n! cd\n? c\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n8\n! hello\n! codeforces\n? c\n. o\n? d\n? h\n. l\n? e\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n7\n! ababahalamaha\n? a\n? b\n? a\n? b\n? a\n? h\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case after the first action it becomes clear that the selected letter is one of the following: a, b, c. After the second action we can note that the selected letter is not a. Valentin tells word \"b\" and doesn't get a shock. After that it is clear that the selected letter is c, but Valentin pronounces the word cd and gets an excessive electric shock. \n\nIn the second test case after the first two electric shocks we understand that the selected letter is e or o. Valentin tries some words consisting of these letters and after the second word it's clear that the selected letter is e, but Valentin makes 3 more actions before he makes a correct hypothesis.\n\nIn the third example the selected letter can be uniquely determined only when Valentin guesses it, so he didn't get excessive electric shocks.",

Determine which row each passenger will take.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of rows in the bus.\n\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_n (1 \u2264 w_i \u2264 10^{9}), where w_i is the width of each of the seats in the i-th row. It is guaranteed that all w_i are distinct.\n\nThe third line contains a string of length 2n, consisting of digits '0' and '1' \u2014 the description of the order the passengers enter the bus. If the j-th character is '0', then the passenger that enters the bus on the j-th stop is an introvert. If the j-th character is '1', the the passenger that enters the bus on the j-th stop is an extrovert. It is guaranteed that the number of extroverts equals the number of introverts (i. e. both numbers equal n), and for each extrovert there always is a suitable row.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint 2n integers \u2014 the rows the passengers will take.

The second passenger (introvert) chooses the row 1, because it is the only empty row now. The third passenger (extrovert) chooses the row 1, because it has exactly one occupied seat and the seat width is the largest among such rows. The fourth passenger (extrovert) chooses the row 2, because it is the only row with an empty place.",

        "instruction": "Berland forest was planted several decades ago in a formation of an infinite grid with a single tree in every cell. Now the trees are grown up and they form a pretty dense structure.\n\nSo dense, actually, that the fire became a real danger for the forest. This season had been abnormally hot in Berland and some trees got caught on fire! \n\nThe second fire started is considered the second 0. Every second fire lit up all intact neightbouring trees to every currently burning tree. The tree is neighbouring if it occupies adjacent by side or by corner cell. Luckily, after t seconds Berland fire department finally reached the location of fire and instantaneously extinguished it all.\n\nNow they want to calculate the destructive power of the fire. Let val_{x, y} be the second the tree in cell (x, y) got caught on fire. The destructive power is the sum of val_{x, y} over all (x, y) of burnt trees.\n\nClearly, all the workers of fire department are firefighters, not programmers, thus they asked you to help them calculate the destructive power of the fire.\n\nThe result can be rather big, so print it modulo 998244353.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 10^8) \u2014 the number of trees that initially got caught on fire and the time fire department extinguished the fire, respectively.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains two integers x and y (-10^8 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^8) \u2014 the positions of trees that initially got caught on fire.\n\nObviously, the position of cell (0, 0) on the grid and the directions of axes is irrelevant as the grid is infinite and the answer doesn't depend on them.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all the given tree positions are pairwise distinct.\n\nThe grid is infinite so the fire doesn't stop once it reaches -10^8 or 10^8. It continues beyond these borders.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the sum of val_{x, y} over all (x, y) of burnt trees modulo 998244353.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n1 2\n10 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n40\n\nInput\n\n\n4 1\n2 2\n1 3\n0 2\n2 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n18\n\nInput\n\n\n3 0\n0 0\n-2 1\n1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nHere are the first three examples.

        "output": "SOLUTION STEPS:\n1. Read the input values for n (number of trees initially caught on fire) and t (time at which the fire department extinguished the fire).\n2. Read the positions of the trees that initially got caught on fire and store them in an array a.\n3. Initialize an array Colli to store the collision times between different pairs of trees.\n4. Calculate the collision times between all pairs of trees and store them in Colli.\n5. Sort the collision times in Colli in ascending order.\n6. Initialize a variable ti to 1, which will be used to iterate through the collision times.\n7. Initialize a variable ans to 0, which will store the destructive power of the fire.\n8. Calculate the destructive power of the fire at time t and add it to ans.\n9. While ti is less than the number of collision times and the current collision time is less than t:\n   - If the difference between the current and next collision times is less than or equal to 4, calculate the destructive power of the fire at each time point between the current and next collision times and subtract it from ans.\n   - Otherwise, calculate the destructive power of the fire at each time point between the current collision time and the next time point that is 4 units away, and subtract it from ans.\n10.

The robot has a battery and an accumulator with a solar panel.\n\nThe i-th segment of the path (from X=i-1 to X=i) can be exposed to sunlight or not. The array s denotes which segments are exposed to sunlight: if segment i is exposed, then s_i = 1, otherwise s_i = 0.\n\nThe robot has one battery of capacity b and one accumulator of capacity a. For each segment, you should choose which type of energy storage robot will use to go to the next point (it can be either battery or accumulator). If the robot goes using the battery, the current charge of the battery is decreased by one (the robot can't use the battery if its charge is zero). And if the robot goes using the accumulator, the current charge of the accumulator is decreased by one (and the robot also can't use the accumulator if its charge is zero).\n\nIf the current segment is exposed to sunlight and the robot goes through it using the battery, the charge of the accumulator increases by one (of course, its charge can't become higher than it's maximum capacity).\n\nIf accumulator is used to pass some segment, its charge decreases by 1 no matter if the segment is exposed or not.\n\nYou understand that it is not always possible to walk to X=n. You want your robot to go as far as possible.

The second segment can be passed using the battery, and charge levels become b=1 and a=1. The third segment can be passed using the accumulator, and charge levels become b=1 and a=0. The fourth segment can be passed using the battery, and charge levels become b=0 and a=1.

        "instruction": "Old timers of Summer Informatics School can remember previous camps in which each student was given a drink of his choice on the vechorka (late-evening meal). Or may be the story was more complicated?\n\nThere are n students living in a building, and for each of them the favorite drink a_i is known. So you know n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 k) is the type of the favorite drink of the i-th student. The drink types are numbered from 1 to k.\n\nThere are infinite number of drink sets. Each set consists of exactly two portions of the same drink. In other words, there are k types of drink sets, the j-th type contains two portions of the drink j. The available number of sets of each of the k types is infinite.\n\nYou know that students will receive the minimum possible number of sets to give all students exactly one drink. Obviously, the number of sets will be exactly \u2308 n/2 \u2309, where \u2308 x \u2309 is x rounded up.\n\nAfter students receive the sets, they will distribute their portions by their choice: each student will get exactly one portion. Note, that if n is odd then one portion will remain unused and the students' teacher will drink it.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of students that can get their favorite drink if \u2308 n/2 \u2309 sets will be chosen optimally and students will distribute portions between themselves optimally?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of students in the building and the number of different drinks.\n\nThe next n lines contain student's favorite drinks. The i-th line contains a single integer from 1 to k \u2014 the type of the favorite drink of the i-th student.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint exactly one integer \u2014 the maximum number of students that can get a favorite drink.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n1\n3\n1\n1\n2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 3\n2\n1\n3\n2\n3\n3\n1\n3\n1\n2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n9\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, students could choose three sets with drinks 1, 1 and 2 (so they will have two sets with two drinks of the type 1 each and one set with two drinks of the type 2, so portions will be 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2). This way all students except the second one will get their favorite drinks.\n\nAnother possible answer is sets with drinks 1, 2 and 3. In this case the portions will be 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. Then all the students except one will gain their favorite drinks. The only student that will not gain the favorite drink will be a student with a_i = 1 (i.e. the first, the third or the fourth).",

Here are the examples of all six types:\n\n<image> Types of pipes \n\nYou can turn each of the given pipes 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times (so the types 1 and 2 can become each other and types 3, 4, 5, 6 can become each other).\n\nYou want to turn some pipes in a way that the water flow can start at (1, 0) (to the left of the top left pipe), move to the pipe at (1, 1), flow somehow by connected pipes to the pipe at (2, n) and flow right to (2, n + 1).\n\nPipes are connected if they are adjacent in the system and their ends are connected.

Find any required partition, you should not minimize or maximize the number of parts.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (-10^6 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^6 and a_i \u2260 0).\n\nOutput\n\nIf there is no valid partition, print -1. Otherwise, print any valid partition in the following format:\n\n  * On the first line print the number d of days (1 \u2264 d \u2264 n). \n  * On the second line, print d integers c_1, c_2, \u2026, c_d (1 \u2264 c_i \u2264 n and c_1 + c_2 + \u2026 + c_d = n), where c_i is the number of events in the i-th day. \n\n\n\nIf there are many valid solutions, you can print any of them. You don't have to minimize nor maximize the number of days.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n1 7 -7 3 -1 -3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n6\n\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n1 -1 1 2 -1 -2 3 -3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n2 6\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2 5 -5 5 -5 -2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n-8 1 1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, the whole array is a valid day.\n\nIn the second example, one possible valid solution is to split the array into [1, -1] and [1, 2, -1, -2, 3, -3] (d = 2 and c = [2, 6]). The only other valid solution would be to split the array into [1, -1], [1, 2, -1, -2] and [3, -3] (d = 3 and c = [2, 4, 2]). Both solutions are accepted.\n\nIn the third and fourth examples, we can prove that there exists no valid solution.
